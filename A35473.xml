            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER, TO THOSE ESPECIALLY OF THIS City, who have been the movers, and continue the Promoters of this WORK.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>OLOMON, who made Many Bookes, tells us (toward the end of one of them, <hi>Eccl. 12.12.) That, of making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books there is no end, and, that much ſtudy is a wearineſſe to the fleſh.</hi> But while <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes thus, doth he not at once blot thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books which himſelfe had written, and diſcourage others from writing any more? Though <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be a wearineſſe to the fleſh,</hi> yet ('tis granted) that's no ſufficient reaſon why we ſhould deſiſt (the fleſh muſt be wearied and hard wrought, 'tis good it ſhould be ſo) But there's no colour of reaſon, why we ſhould begin that, which eyther cannot be finiſht and brought to an end or which is to no end, when 'tis brought to an end, and finiſht. How then ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> that <hi>of making many Books there
<pb facs="tcp:48478:3"/> is no end?</hi> His ſcope cleares this ſcruple; for, having read his Son a Lecture upon the vanity of the Creature, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given him many excellent advices, for the due ſteering of his courſe through this World, he applyes all in the former part of this Verſe, <hi>And further by theſe, my Son, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed.</hi> Let what is now written take upon thy heart, and be accepted with thee. For <hi>(Verſ. 10.) The Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſought to finde out acceptable words, and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</hi> Againe <hi>(Verſ. 11.) The words of the Wiſe are as Goads, and as Nayles faſtned by the Maſters of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which are given from one Shepheard:</hi> Therefore, let theſe words, like Goads, put thee on, and like Nayles, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten thee to the obedience of my counſels; <hi>By theſe, my Son, be admoniſhed:</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Let not this Booke, which diſcovers the vanity of all worldly things, be it ſelfe accounted vaine; If this Book prevaile not with thee, if it maſter not thy judgement, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage not thy affections, 'tis to no end for me to make many Bookes; ſeeing this is cloathed with as much compleatneſſe of rule to direct, as a Book, of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can be, and is ſtampt with as much ſtrength of Authority to command, as any Book of any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can be: And further, why ſhouldeſt thou, my Son, put mee to the making of many Bookes? What if I could make many with as much eaſe to my owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as I have made this one, which was given me in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by the ſpirit? yet thou canſt not ſtudy</hi> (or as we put in the Margin, <hi>read) many Books without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ineſſe to thy fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, though <hi>Solomon</hi> might have juſt had ground to put the affectation both of writing and reading many Books, upon the file of his obſerved vanities; yet hee doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige from the ſtudy of neceſſary and ſerious Books; nor at all condemne thoſe many Monuments of profitable learning,
<pb facs="tcp:48478:3"/> which induſtrious Pens have in any Age bequeathed to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. He indeed (which yet is but a ſecond deſigne, if it be at all the deſigne of that place) takes us off from vaine ſtudies, and cenſures thoſe Bookes (be they few as well as many) which have no tendency to make any man, eyther the wiſer, or the better by reading them. Nor can thoſe Books <hi>how many</hi> ſoever they are, be (to their diſparagement) called <hi>Many,</hi> which center in, and promote (what is but one in every kinde) any kinde of Truth, cheifely that, which we call Divine, or Holy Truth. Any <hi>One</hi> uſeleſſe, or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Booke is <hi>too many:</hi> Many uſefull and Orthodox Bookes are but <hi>One.</hi> The five Bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> are but <hi>One Law:</hi> The foure Bookes of the Birth, Life, and Death, of <hi>our ever bleſſed Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are but <hi>One Goſpell:</hi> All the Bookes of both Teſtaments are but one Booke. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which account we may alſo ſay, that, All thoſe <hi>many and many</hi> Bookes which faithfully interpret <hi>That one Booke</hi> are but <hi>one Booke.</hi> And though of making many ſuch Bookes, there ſhould (as I conceive there will) be no end, till this World ends, as End is taken for a ceaſing to make them; yet of making many ſuch Bookes there is an end, yea many noble ends, as End is taken for the good, or benefit which comes by making them. The making of ſuch Bookes is good, and a benefit to the Reader, as communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him thoſe <hi>manifeſtations of the ſpirit which are given to every man</hi> (to whom they are given) <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withall:</hi> The word (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) there uſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ſignifies ſuch a profit as ſtreameth out to community. The making of ſuch Bookes is alſo good, and a benefit to the Maker, as being an improvement of his Time and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, to his owne peace and his Maſters glory. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beyond all the World can give, for any worke, that God hath glory, and man peace, in doing it. As this ſmall peice of worke is directed to theſe laſt mentioned ends, and (as it ought) principally to the firſt of them; ſo, that it
<pb facs="tcp:48478:4"/> may reach the former, by adding a Mite or two to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the Readers knowledge in the <hi>beſt things,</hi> and by being his encouragement, to walke in the <hi>beſt wayes,</hi> is the hope and prayer, and the reaching of it, will be indeed, a very rich reward and payment of,</p>

                  </note> Charity ſuggeſts a fairer interpretation of this procedure, that he ſpake thus harſhly, and dealt thus roughly, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſome unwary paſſages in <hi>Jobs</hi> diſcourſe, not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood or miſapplyed. At which ſtone how many ſtumble at this day! Firſt, miſconceiving, and then censuring their Brethren; being firſt offended without any juſt cauſe given, and then giving juſt cauſe of offence.

We ſhall make a good improvement of this fayling in <hi>Jobs</hi> Freind, if it may be our warning (in dealing) to deale better with our Freinds.</p>
               <p>There are three parts of this Speech; in the firſt, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> appeares by way of reproofe, and reprehenſion, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelfe from the beginning of the Chapter, to the end of the thirteenth Verſe; and he reproves <hi>Job</hi> upon five points of errour, or misbehaviour, of all which he conceived him guilty.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He reproves him of folly, or for ſpeaking that which was unworthy a wiſe man, in the ſecond and third Verſes, <hi>Should a wiſe man utter vaine knowledge?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He reproves him of prophaneneſſe, or for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was unworthy a godly man, at the fourth Verſe, <hi>Yea, thou caſteſt off feare, and reſtraineſt prayer before God.</hi> The ſumme of both is, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt unwiſely, and thou acteſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly:</hi> which he takes for ſo plaine a charge, that hee makes him his owne accuſer, as if there needed no evidence but his conſcience, though hee had (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> miſ-judged) dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed up the matter with faire words, and colourable preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 5, 6.) <hi>Thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity: Thine owne mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine owne lips teſtifie againſt thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He reproves him of pride, and arrogance, of ſelfe-conceit, and overweening his owne parts, and poſitions (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10.) <hi>Art thou the firſt man that was borne, or waſt thou made before the Hills, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Thou carryeſt it, as if thou hadſt engroſſed all wiſedome, as if thou hadſt more knowledge and underſtanding, more learning and experience, then any man; yea then all men living.</hi>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48478:5"/>

                     <hi>Vaine knowledge.</hi> The letter of the Hebrew is <hi>knowledge of winde,</hi> or <hi>windy knowledge:</hi> The Metaphor is elegant; vaine knowledge is juſtly called windy knowledge; Vaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge makes a great bluſter, and noiſe, like the wind, but it paſſeth away, and though we cannot tell whither it goes, yet we may eaſily tell whence it comes, even from the fancie, and out of the mouth of a fooliſh man. It was uſuall of old, to call that which is <hi>vaine, windy;</hi> thoſe deſpiſers of holy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, and Divine Alarums, given by the Prophets, ſaid, <hi>The Prophets ſhall become wind, and the word is not in them, Jer.</hi> 5.13. That is, both the Doctrine and the threats which theſe Prophets utter, are vaine and ineffectuall; they will doe us
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48478:6"/> neither good nor evill; no mans finger ſhall ake, though their tongues ake with talking.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> at once reproves and terriſies the <hi>Jewes</hi> in this language, <hi>They have ſowne the wind, and they ſhall reape the whirlewind (Hoſ.</hi> 8.7.) To ſow the winde, is to doe a vaine thing; our actions are as ſeed: ſuch as we ſow, ſuch ſhall we reape; they ſowed ſin, and they reaped trouble. Themſelves ſowed the wind by what they did, and they thought the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſowed the winde in what they ſpake: And indeed the words of the Prophet were wind as the peoples works were, in reference to the iſſue; thoſe produced a whirlewind to ſcatter their contemners, as theſe did to ſcatter their actors. The old Satyriſt calls <hi>vaine words, bubly toyes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bullatas nugas utpote ſimiles bullis vento plenis, <hi>Perſ. Sat. 5.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe ſuch words are like a bubble, full of wind (poſſibly full of wit) but empty of wiſedome and good inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Should a wiſe man utter vaine knowledge?</hi> The Scripture calls that vaine:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, which is unprofitable, theſe mutually expound each other, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Vanity of vanity, ſaith the Preacher,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What profit hath a man of all the labour which he taketh under the Sunne.</hi> There's moſt vanity, where there is leaſt profit, and where there is no profit at all, there is nothing at all but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>Turne not aſide from following the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Samuel) for then ſhould you goe after vaine things which cannot profit,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Scripture calls that and thoſe vaine, which hath or have no ſolidity in them; vanity hath ſo little weight in it, that when the Spirit would expreſſe men who have no weight in them, he ſaith, <hi>They are lighter then vanity, Pſalm.</hi> 62.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Scripture calls that vaine which is alwayes moving, varying, and unſetled, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.4.) <hi>Man is like to vanity, his dayes are as a ſhadow that paſſeth away:</hi> He is therefore like to vanity, becauſe he is ſo like a ſhadow, continually paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but never continuing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Scripture often calls that vaine which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in practice, or unſound and erroneous in opinion, <hi>I hate vaine inventions</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) but thy Law doe I love.</hi> Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever oppoſes either truth of Doctrine, or purity of Worſhip is a vaine invention of man, and oppoſite to the Law of God;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48478:7"/> he <hi>utters vaine knowledge,</hi> who utters falſe Principles which ſubvert the Faith, or ſuperſtitious formes which endanger the life and power of godlineſſe. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſuppoſed, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of vanity in all theſe notions, was rallyed together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the diſcourſe of <hi>Job,</hi> that it was light and froathy, that it was erroneous and full of incongruity, eſpecially (which carries all theſe in it) that it was worthleſſe and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the receiver, as he expreſſeth in the third Verſe, <hi>Should he reaſon with unprofitable talke?</hi>

                     <hi>There is a vanity in ſome kind of knowledge, and folly in that which not a few call wiſedome:</hi> It hath been the buſineſſe of ſome mens knowledge, to finde out a vanity in all ſorts of knowledge. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake well for the matter, though ill to the man. <hi>Job</hi> did not utter vaine knowledge, but, we know, too many doe.

Philoſophy in it ſelfe is an excellent knowledge, yet it may be vainely taught, and ſo deceive us, as to ſpoyle us: I may ſay alſo, let no man ſpoyle you through Divinity and vaine deceit. Divinity, which is in it ſelfe the moſt excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the knowledge of God, may be vainely taught, and ſo deceive us, as to ſpoyle us: <hi>That knowledge which is beſt in it ſelfe, is vaineſt to us, when it is unduely or falſely uttered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>It is moſt uncomely for thoſe, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have, or would have the reputation of wiſedome, to ſpeake vainly; Should a wiſe man utter vaine knowledge?</hi> 'Tis no wonder to heare a vaine man ſpeake vainely, and for a foole to utter folly. <hi>Doe men gather Grapes of thornes, or Figgs of thiſtles? The vile perſon will ſpeake villany, and his heart will worke iniquity, to practice hypocriſie, and to utter errour againſt the Lord (Iſa.</hi> 32.6.) If a foole, a vaine man, or a vile perſon, ſpeake thus, he ſpeakes like himſelfe, but if a wiſe, or a good man ſpeake thus, he ſpeakes ſo unlike himſelfe, that the Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe puts not onely an undecenſie, but an impoſſibility

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Paſſions in the minde are like a tempeſt in the ayre, they diſturbe others much, but our ſelves more:</hi> Many a man (like a Ship at Sea) hath been overſet and ſunke with the violent guſts and whirle-whinds of his owne Spirit.</p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48478:8"/>
                  <p>Obſerve thirdly, <hi>He that fills his owne minde with paſſionate thoughts, will ſoone fill the eares of others with unprofitable words;</hi> this is cleare from that which goeth before, <hi>He utters vaine knowledge;</hi> and it is clearer from that which followes after; when a mans thoughts are like a winde, his words (which are the firſt borne of his thoughts) muſt needs be windy. A paſſionate man ſpeakes all in paſſion, and ſometimes cannot ſpeake at all for paſſion; his extreame deſire to ſay much ſtops him from ſaying any thing: But whatſoever he ſaith, is the copy of his preſent ſelfe, fierce and boyſterous. <hi>The i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſuperſcription of our hearts is ſtamped upon our words.</hi> Some can ſpeake better then they are, but uſually men ſpeak according to what they are, and then eſpecially when they are (which paſſionate men alwayes are) not themſelves. Thus it followes in the next Verſe.</p>

                     <hi>Would you know what to expect from a paſſionate man, from a man whoſe belly is filled with the Eaſt-wind? You ſhall have him ſhortly filling your eares with an Eaſt wind, even reaſoning with unprofitable words:</hi> And (as the next clauſe gives it, which is onely an expoſition of this) <hi>with ſpeeches wherewith he can doe no good:</hi> Some words are great doers, they doe much hurt, or they doe much good, and thoſe words uſually doe ſome hurt, which can do no good; yea, that which is weake and unable to doe good, may be ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to doe evill. However, not to doe good is to doe evill, becauſe it is every mans duty, whatſoever he doth, to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good: Here <hi>Eliphaz</hi> reproves <hi>Jobs</hi> words as evill, while he onely ſaith, they doe no good. And yet he ſaith ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then that, for he ſaith, <hi>They can doe no good:</hi> It is ill not to doe good actually, but not to have a poſſibility of doing good is farre worſe. When the Apoſtle would ſay his

                  <p>Hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That which can doe no good, ſhould not be ſpoken:</hi> Before we ſpeake a word, we ſhould aske this queſtion, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<note place="margin">Cui bono.</note> to what profit is it? ſhall he that heares it be made more knowing, or more holy by it?</p>
                  <p>Obſerve ſecondly, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitable talke is ſinfull, and ſpeeches which doe no good, are evill:</hi> Every idle word that men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall give an account thereof in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.37. and though a man be very buſie, and take much paines in ſpeaking, yet if his words be unprofitable, and his ſpeeches ſuch as can doe no good, they will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der account as idle. Now, if unprofitable talke be ſinfull, and ſpeeches that can doe no good, then what is prophane talke, and ſpeeches which doe hurt, (infection gets quickly in at the eare) defiling the minde and corrupting the manners of thoſe that heare them. The Apoſtle gives us the rule of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, both in the negative and in the affirmative (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29.) <hi>Let no corrupt communications proceed out of your mouths, but that which is good to the uſe of edifying, which may adminiſter grace to the hearer.</hi> Againe, (<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>Let your ſpeeches be alwaies with grace;</hi> that is, ſuch as teſtifieth that there is grace in your heart, never ſpeake a word but ſuch as may ſtand with grace; yea, ſpeake ſuch words as may be a witneſſe of grace, wrought in your ſelves, and a meanes of working grace in others.

                  <p>Thirdly obſerve, <hi>It is matter of juſt reproofe againſt every man to be unprofitable, and to doe no good:</hi> Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen downe and caſt into the fire, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10.) Some conceive that the word <hi>Belial</hi> comes from <hi>Beli,</hi> which in Hebrew ſignifies <hi>Not,</hi> and the word <hi>Jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> which here in the Text ſignifies to doe good: Becauſe a Belialiſt, or a Son of <hi>Belial</hi> is ſuch a one as neither doth

                  <p>Firſt, it is taken for the holy awe or reverence we beare to God in our ſpirits, which is the worſhip of the firſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and the ſanctifying of God in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the outward acts of Religion, which is the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48478:10"/> worſhip of the ſecond Commandement, <hi>Their feare is taught by the precepts of men (Iſa.</hi> 29.13.) that is, their outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Religion, is ſuch as men have invented, not ſuch as God hath appointed: Some take it here in the firſt ſenſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>thou caſteſt off feare;</hi> that is, thou caſteſt off that awe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and regard thou oweſt to the Name of God; others underſtand it in the ſecond, <hi>Thou caſteſt off feare;</hi> that is, the outward worſhip and ſervice of God: but I conceive we have that expreſſed in the next clauſe,<note place="margin">Timor hoc loco pro reverentia &amp; tremore, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius quam pro religione &amp; cultu, licet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trumque cohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat. <hi>Pined.</hi>

                  <p>But what cauſe had <hi>Job</hi> given <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to charge him with caſting off the feare of the Lord; we finde <hi>Eliphaz</hi> touching upon this point before, and upbraiding <hi>Job, (Chap.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>Is this thy feare?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That to caſt off the feare of God is higheſt wickedneſſe;</hi> to caſt off the feare of God is the beginning of wickedneſſe, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine <hi>The feare of God is the beginning of wiſedome;</hi> the word, here uſed, ſignifieth not onely the beginning but the top, the chiefe, the head and higheſt perfection of a thing: the feare of God is both firſt and laſt, the beginning and end of holineſſe. <hi>To feare God, and keep his Commandements, is all man in goodneſſe, to caſt off the feare of God, is all man in ſinfulneſſe:</hi> the beginning and end of wickedneſſe; <hi>It is ill not to have the feare of God, but it is farre worſe to caſt of the feare of God;</hi> it is ill not to chuſe the feare of God (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.29.) but to reject the feare of the Lord that is deſperate; if once feare be caſt off, all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is let in; at the ſame doore, at which the feare of the Lord goes out, any ſin may enter: As <hi>Abraham</hi> ſayd, <hi>The feare of God is not in this place, and they will kill me for my Wives ſake;</hi> they have no impediment of luſt to caſt off, who have once caſt off the feare of God. And as they who caſt off this feare are ready to doe or ſay any thing that's evill; ſo they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to doe or ſay any thing that is good; as they have no reſtraint upon them from iniquity, ſo they can eaſily reſtrain themſelves from duty: The next words ſhew this.</p>

                  <p>Here againe it may be queſtioned, What cauſe had <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to charge <hi>Job</hi> with <hi>reſtraining prayer?</hi> The Jewiſh Writers ſay, it was becauſe he denyed Providence,<note place="margin">Hebraei ad id referunt, quod putant <hi>Jobum</hi> Dei providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam negaſſe, quod nos non putamus. <hi>Mer. q d.</hi> iſta tua aſſertio &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina, quod mala &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicia eveniant bonis &amp; juſtis tollit religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum divini nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis cultum.</note> and ſo by conſequence Prayer; for if God doe not order the affaires of the World, the afflictions and deliverances of his people, why ſhould we pray to him about them? Others referre it not to his denyall of Providence, but to that which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſuppoſed a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall errour againſt the Doctrine of Providence, <hi>That God deſtroyeth the righteous and the wicked; That he laughs at the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the innocent.</hi> Now will any innocent man pray to God in his affliction, when he is told that God laughs at his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Will any righteous man call upon God for help, when he is taught that God deſtroyeth the righteous? Who would ſerve a Maſter who gives ſuch wages, and payes thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with diſgrace, yea with deſtruction? So that <hi>Job</hi> is charged with reſtraining Prayer according to this anſwer to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48478:11"/> the queſtion, not becauſe he totally forbore prayer himſelfe, or perſwaded others to forbeare it; but becauſe <hi>Jobs</hi> aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſuch as might yeeld thoſe conſequences, and cauſe many to ſuſpend Prayer, or give over calling upon the Name of God in the day of trouble. We may be charged to ſay or doe that, which flowes from what we doe or ſay, though we neither ſay nor doe the thing it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Many are guilty of thoſe errors conſequentially, which yet they never affirmed thetically or directly. We may be ſo farre from aſſerting, that we may profeſſedly abhorre an opinion which yet lyeth ſecretly under ſome of our aſſertions. We ſay juſtly, That the Pope is Antichriſt, and that pure Popery is Antichriſtianiſme; yet the Pope doth not deny Chriſt, for the Pope thinks himſelf Chriſts Vicar upon earth, and therefore muſt needs acknowledge him to be come in the fleſh, yet by conſequence, the Pope is an oppoſer both of the Perſon and Offices of Chriſt, and popiſh Doctrine fights againſt the truth of Chriſt. As prophane men <hi>Profeſſe they know God, yet in their workes they deny him (Tit.</hi> 1.16.) So many erroneous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons profeſſe they love and honour thoſe holy truths and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall duties, which by conſequences they indeed deny, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (though unduely) ſuppoſed <hi>Job</hi> had done, the duty of Prayer.</p>
                  <q>Thou reſtraineſt prayer before God.</q>
                  <p>Taking the words abſtractly, they yeeld us this uſefull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>That it is an argument of an evill heart, to ſhorten,</hi>

                     <hi>or reſtraine, to leſſen, or to give off Prayer in times of trouble.</hi> That King ſpake to the height of prophaneneſſe, when he ſaid (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.) <hi>This evill is of the Lord, and why ſhould I waite on the Lord any longer?</hi> When we have done waiting, we have done praying. No man will aske for that which he doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to receive. How long ſo ever affliction laſteth, ſo long prayer-ſeaſon laſteth; if the Winter day of our trouble, be a Summer day in length, if it be continued many dayes, yea many moneths, and yeares, prayer ſhould continue (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15.) <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble and I will heare, and thou ſhalt glorifie me;</hi> Let the day of trouble be ſhort or long, God lookes to heare of us all that day. Is any afflicted let him pray, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James;</hi> it is a duty to pray, when we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48478:12"/> are not afflicted, when we proſper in the World: But <hi>is any man afflicted,</hi> then is a ſpeciall ſeaſon for prayer. A ſincere heart prayes alwayes, or continues in prayer; an hypocrite never loves to pray, and at two ſeaſons he will reſtraine, or lay aſide prayer: Firſt, when he is got out, or thinks he hath prayed himſelfe out of affliction. Proſperity and worldly fulneſſe ſtop the mouth of prayer, and he hath no more to ſay to God, when he hath received much from God. Secondly, a Hypocrite reſtraines prayer, when he perceives he hath got nothing by prayer; he ſees he cannot, or feares he ſhall not get out of trouble, and therefore he will pray no more in trouble; his ſpirit failes, becauſe his afflictions hold out. Upon which ſoever of theſe two grounds, the Hypocrite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines prayer, he ſhewes the wickedneſſe of his heart. If from the former, he ſhewes, that he beares no true love to God; if from the latter, he ſhewes that he hath no true faith in God, or dares not truſt him. Further, to caſt off prayer, is to caſt off God; and he that lives without prayer in the World, lives without God in the World: Hence <hi>the Heathen who know not God, and the Families that call not upon his Name,</hi> are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or rather are the ſame (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25.) Further, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine prayer, is worſe then not to pray: The latter notes onely a neglect of the duty, the fromer a diſtaſt of the duty. To give over any holy exerciſe is more dangerous then not to begin or take it up. The one is the prophane mans ſin, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Hypocrites. <hi>Thou reſtraineſt prayer:</hi> and hee that doth not utter prayer with his mouth, will ſoone utter wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe with his mouth, as it follows.</p>

                  <p>Here <hi>Eliphaz</hi> explaines, and proves what he ſaid before, that <hi>Job</hi> had caſt off the feare of God, and reſtrained prayer; as if he had ſaid, <hi>If thou hadſt kept in holy feare, that would have kept in thine iniquity: Hadſt thou not reſtrained prayer, that would have reſtrained, and bridled downe thy ſin; but thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and that ſheweth that prayer is reſtrained, and that feare is caſt off;</hi> here is a demonſtration of it; If you ſhould come to a Princes Court, and ſee a great croud about the doore, you would ſay, the Porter is there, he ſtops and examines them; if
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48478:12"/> at another time you ſee all going in as faſt as they pleaſe, you will ſay the Porter is out of the way. Thus while the feare of the Lord ſtands like a Porter at the doore of the ſoule, we keep our thoughts and actions in compaſſe; we examine what goes in, and what comes out: but when once thats gone,<note place="margin">Non opus eſt ut te doceam in quo pecces, cum ipſe tuus ſermo doceat te ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum eſſe. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tab.</hi> Reus verbis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris tui. <hi>Sept,</hi>
                     </note> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is gone. Any thing may be ſayd, any thing may be done by him, who feares not, who prayes not. Thou haſt caſt off feare, and reſtrained prayer, for thy mouth uttereth thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, out it comes, as faſt as it can: I need not tell thee wherein thou haſt offended, thy mouth powres it out.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, <hi>That the evill which is in the heart will out at the mouth, unleſſe prayer and the feare of God reſtraine it:</hi> As the good that is in the heart will come out of the mouth, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when prayer unlocks the mouth. <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Lord open thou my lips,</hi> and then he undertakes for his mouth, that it ſhall <hi>ſhew forth the praiſe of God. (Pſal.</hi> 51.1.) <hi>My heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting a good matter</hi> (the heart doth this in prayer or medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) what follows, <hi>My tongue is as the Pen of a ready Writer:</hi> Heavenly thoughts in the heart, ſhoot out at the tongue in heavenly words. When the heart is deviſing of a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the tongue will be ſwift to ſpeake, and ſet all to a good tune. Thus alſo while the heart is inditing an evill matter, the tongue runs to evill: Such a man needs not learne from others, he hath a root of bitterneſſe in himſelfe: Hence our Saviour concludes (<hi>Matth.</hi> 12.37.) <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be condemned, and by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified:</hi> Why ſhall we be condemned by our words?<note place="margin">Qualis vir ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis oratio. Mens mala linguam movet &amp; vos fingit ad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probos ſenſus neque aliud os loquitur quam quod interior ſuggerit atque imperat ſenſus.</note> The Prophet complaines of thoſe who made a man an offender for a word; I anſwer, our words ſhew what we are, they declare our hearts, as a man may be diſcovered of what Country he is, when he ſpeakes, ſo of what ſpirit he is. <hi>The tongue is the ſcholler of the heart, and ſpeakes what that dictates:</hi> A man is juſtly condemned by evill words, becauſe they teſtifie that he is evill.</p>
                  <q>Thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity.</q>
                  <p>Obſerve Secondly, <hi>There are ſome iniquities which are more properly ours then ſome others are. Thine iniquity: Job</hi> had (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeemes to ſuggeſt) a kind of peculiarity in it. As God ownes ſome people in a ſpeciall manner; though all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the earth be his, yet they are his beloved people: So
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48478:13"/> man ownes ſome ſin in a ſpeciall manner; though a corrupt heart hath a relation to all the ſins in the World, yet ſome one is his beloved ſin; and may be called by way of emmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, his iniquity. 'Tis his, as his Houſes and Lands, as the Money in his Purſe, and the Garments on his backe are his.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve thirdly, Every man is moſt ready to act and utter his ſpeciall iniquity: <hi>Thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity.</hi> There are ſome ſins in a mans heart, which poſſibly, he may never utter all his dayes: but he muſt be talking of, or acting his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved one. Hence <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes it, as a high worke of grace in him (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23.) <hi>I have kept my ſelfe from mine iniquity:</hi> Even a godly man who diſownes every ſin, hath ſome one ſin more his owne then others. This findes him work (not to doe it) but to keep himſelfe from doing it.</p>
                  <q>And thou chuſeſt the tongue of the crafty:</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſayd, Thou waſt wont to ſpeake prayer, now thou ſpeakſt pollicy, thou dealeſt cunningly and deceitfully with us, not plainely and clearely.

Thou ſpeakeſt as if thou wert willing to be taught, ſhew me my errour, and I will turne from it; yet this is from craft not from conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                  <p>Laſtly, whereas he ſaith, <hi>Thou chuſeſt the tongue of the crafty;</hi> he heightens his accuſation, and would repreſent this good man to the eye of the world in a blacker hue. To chuſe, notes a mixt act both of the underſtanding, will, and affections; and it ſeemes here to be oppoſed to that wicked act (but not in the wickedneſſe of it) where-with he beſpatter'd <hi>Job</hi> in the former Verſe, <hi>Thou caſteſt off feare:</hi> To <hi>caſt off,</hi> or reprobate, is contrary to electing or <hi>chuſing,</hi> and ſo is the feare of God to craft. The feare of God is the beginning of wiſedome, a good underſtanding have all they that doe thereafter; but craft is onely the corruption of wiſedome, and they have no good underſtanding who doe thereafter. Now, when Divine feare and humane craft ſtand in competition, for a man to give his vote for craft, and to refuſe, at leaſt to let paſſe the feare of the Lord, this is one of the higheſt growths of ſinfull corruption. He that doth thus, needs neither Judge nor witneſſe againſt him, he is both himſelfe; ſo <hi>Eliphaz</hi> reſolves it in the next Verſe.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet, (<hi>Iſa</hi> 44.9.) ſaith of Image-makers, <hi>They are all of them vanity, their delectable things ſhall not profit them, and they are their owne witneſſes; they ſee not, nor know, that they may be aſhamed:</hi> Images ſhew what both they and their worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are; though no man ſhould ſpeake a word againſt them, they having tongues and cannot ſpeake, ſpeake enough againſt themſelves: their ſilence, or dumbneſſe rather, proclaimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud to all the World, that they are vaine and dunghill Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; they can doe neither good nor evill, to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Gods, and they who worſhip them doe not ſo much <hi>as ſhew themſelves men, Iſa.</hi> 46.8.

               <p>THe firſt part of this Chapter, is reprehenſory. In the former context two points of reproofe were opened: Firſt <hi>Jobs</hi> ſuppoſed folly in the ſecond and third Verſes: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his wickedneſſe, in the fourth, both which were aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the fifth and ſixth.</p>
               <p>In this Context <hi>Eliphaz</hi> gives him a third and a fourth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe; a third, for the high conceit he had of himſelfe, and a fourth, for the low conceit he had of the comforts of God, tendered to him by his Freinds; he reproves him for the high conceit he had of himſelfe, in two things: Firſt, as if <hi>Job</hi> had thought his experience greater then any mans, <hi>Art thou the firſt man that was borne? &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 7. Secondly, as if he had thought himſelfe immediately inſpired, <hi>Haſt thou heard the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of God, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 8.</p>
               <p>This he illuſtrates by a twofold oppoſition in the ninth and tenth Verſes; Firſt, by the oppoſition of himſelfe and his Freinds in point of knowledge and underſtanding unto <hi>Job:</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Thou lookeſt upon us as underlings, as men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to carry thy Bookes after thee, or to be named the ſame day, but what knoweſt thou, that wee know not? What underſtandeſt thou, which is not in us?</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>Thou art not ſo weighty, but we hope we may very well ballance thee, and ſay</hi> (without pride or partiality) <hi>that our parts are as good as thine.</hi> Secondly, by the oppoſition of their party to him and his, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>With us are both the gray-headed, and very aged men, much elder then thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Our party equalls thine, as well as our

               <p>As thus he reproves <hi>Jobs</hi> high thoughts of himſelfe, ſo in the fourth place, The low thoughts which he had of them, and the paines they had taken with him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Are the conſolations of God ſmall with thee?</hi> &amp;c.</p>

There is an opinion (I confeſſe) which if true, takes away the ground of this notion, That hills and mountaines grew up, or were as ſo many excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the earth, ſince it was created, and that they grow day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as Naturaliſts expreſſe it) by <hi>Juxtapoſition.</hi> But I fully adhere to their judgement (under which this notion ſtands ſafe) that the earth was diſtinguiſht into hills, plaines, and valleys, by the ſame immediate power which created it, though I eaſily grant that many hills have been accidentally cauſed, and caſt up ſince, eſpecially in the deluge. And this doth more advance the wiſedome of God in the frame of this mighty maſſe, which hath in it greater ornament, and yeelds greater delight by this variety, then if it had been ſmoothed all over into Plaines and Levels.</p>

                  <p>There are two ſorts of Divine ſecrets:

                  </p>
                  <p>The former are of ſuch things as God will doe; the latter, ſuch as Man is either to doe or beleeve: God reveales both to his people. The ordinary way for us is by the Word written, the extraordinary by a word ſpoken: Thus God opened his ſecrets to the ancient Prophets and Apoſtles. The Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos (Chap.</hi> 3.7.) ſpeakes of the ſecrets of providence, <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord will doe nothing, but he revealeth his ſacrets to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets:</hi> And the Lord himſelfe ſaith of <hi>Abraham, Shall I hide from Abraham the things that I am about to doe:</hi> Now as there is a revealing of Providence, or of the workes of God, ſo there is a revealing of Doctrines and of the holy Truths of God. This he promiſeth (<hi>Joel</hi> 2.28.) <hi>I will powre out my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon all fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall propheſie, your old men ſhall dreame dreames, your young men ſhall ſee viſions:</hi> Young men, cannot claime to be the firſt men, they were not before the Hills, yet to them the viſions of Heaven are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: Yet we muſt not neglect that command of our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the teachings of the Word, becauſe wee have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a promiſe of the teachings of the Spirit. The ſpirit u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually teacheth by the Word, never againſt it; and it is a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God, while he gives us meanes, to linger after imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelations: yea, when the Lord reveales himſelfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, he uſes to doe it without mans fore-thought or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. The Prophets did not ſet themſelves to receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from God, but his Spirit came upon them with mighty power and irreſiſtible evidence. And though God doth reveale ſome of his ſecrets, yet he hath ſecrets which he will not reveale: <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that feare him (Pſal.</hi> 24.14.) <hi>And his ſecret is with the righteous (Prov.</hi> 3.32.) This ſecret is either the good will and favour of God, of which the World knowes nothing, or the good Word and Faith of God of which the World knowes as little: Both theſe ſorts of Divine ſecrets are with the righteous, and men fearing God; but the ſecrets of his Counſel are reſerved in his owne breaſt. He reveales to his people the ſecrets of his bounty, and of their duty, what he will doe for them, and what they muſt doe for him; but many things which himſelfe will doe ſhall never be revealed but by the doing of them: <hi>Haſt thou heard the ſecrets of God?</hi>

This is either a charge of greater arrogancy then the former, <hi>Doeſt thou reſtraine wiſedome to thy ſelfe?</hi> or at leaſt a charge of greateſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſſe; goodneſſe is diffuſive, and ſo is wiſedome, and it is the duty of good men to diffuſe wiſedome. When they have heard the ſecrets of God, they muſt communicate them to others, not reſtraine all to themſelves. But I conceive <hi>Eliphaz</hi> intends onely the former charge.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is the higheſt ſtraine of pride for a man to reſtraine wiſedome to himſelfe:</hi> or to thinke himſelfe ſo wiſe, that all muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe to him for wiſedome: God hath not given all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to any one man, or ſort of men, though he hath truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome with more Talents of it then he hath done others. The Prieſts lips of old under the Law, and ſo the lips of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters under the Goſpel, ſhould preſerve knowledge; and the people ſhould ſeek both Law and Goſpel at their mouth (<hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7.) Yet neither might the Prieſts then, nor may Miniſters now, reſtraine wiſedome to themſelves. The rule of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is, <hi>Be not wiſe above what is written;</hi> that is, above <hi>holy Writ,</hi> or above what is written from the immediate dictates of the Spirit of God. <hi>They are</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>fooles in Print, who ſay they are wiſe above what is thus written;</hi> but we may be wiſe above what is ſpoken or written by any man, for no man ought to reſtraine all wiſedome to himſelfe; to doe ſo is the <hi>top-ſtaire of Antichriſtian pride. The Pope reſtraines wiſedome to himſelfe;</hi> he boaſts that he hath the ſecrets of God, and that all muſt come to him if they will have them unlockt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: <hi>His ſentences from the Chayre are Oracles, and there he is infallible;</hi> all are obliged to receive what he ſaith, becauſe he ſaith it: no man muſt ſcruple, much leſſe oppoſe or contradict
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48478:18"/> it. Thus to impoſe upon men is to ſet our ſelves in the place of the God of Heaven; yea, to arrogate to our ſelves that we are Gods on earth. So the Apoſtle hath characteriz'd that <hi>man of ſin</hi> (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>He oppoſeth and exalteth himſelfe above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped</hi> (that is, above all civill powers or Magiſtracy) <hi>So that he as God ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God.</hi> And as <hi>he</hi> out of all meaſure wickedly, ſo many others in a very great meaſure have ſhewed themſelves as God, while they have taken upon them (as we ſpeake proverbially) <hi>To give the Law,</hi> yea, to give the Goſpel to other mens conſciences, or to bind up all mens tongues and judgements unto the rule of their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. When the Apoſtle had called God to record, that he alwayes purpoſed to be bold and plaine with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he preſently ſubjoynes this corrective (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.) <hi>Not that we have Dominion over your Faith, but are helpers of your joy:</hi> As if he had ſayd. Doe not thinke that I take upon me as a Lord over your conſciences, to charge any command or obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my owne upon them: No, I am but as a ſervant of God to inſtruct you in his counſels, and to comfort you with his promiſes.</p>
                  <p>The Grecians, who were men of great knowledge and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a very witty and Philoſophicall people, called all other Nations <hi>Barbarians:</hi> Such pride appeares among ſome (in name) Chriſtians, they ſpeake and act as if all knowledge and truth were centred in them, or as if all were in the darke who ſee not by their light. Knowledge is apt to puffe up, how are they puffed up, who thinke they know all? though indeed they who thinke they know any thing, know nothing as they ought to know, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. God reveales that to Babes and Sucklings, which he hides from ſuch wiſe and prudent ones, who <hi>reſtraine all wiſedome to themſelves.</hi> God in judgement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines wiſedome from them, who in pride reſtraine it to themſelves; and as God takes all wiſedome from them, who in another ſenſe <hi>reſtraine wiſedome to themſelves,</hi> that is, who will not uſe it becauſe they have but one Talent of it, or but a little; ſo he will give them no wiſedome at all, who thinke they are poſſeſſors, or <hi>Lord-Treaſurers</hi> of all the Talents of it, as if all wiſedome were layd up in them.

                     <hi>he cannot beare it that another ſhould be thought or thinke himſelfe wiſer or more knowing then he:</hi> Some are not troubled becauſe they know little, but becauſe they are eſteemed leſſe knowing then others, <hi>What knoweſt thou that we know not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly obſerve, <hi>Though ſome men are of higher parts, and better naturall abilities then others, yet what one man knoweth, others may;</hi> No man can boaſt himſelfe beyond the line and degree of man. For <hi>as the heart of man anſwers the heart of man in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, ſo in a poſſibility of goodneſſe.</hi> One man may be as holy as another, as wiſe and knowing as another; onely God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48478:19"/> is more holy, wiſe, and knowing then any man can be; hee knoweth many things which no man knoweth nor can know. But though it be a ſtraine of pride, for one man to ſay to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>What knoweſt thou that I know not?</hi> Yet it is a truth that one man may know as much as another: and though ſome men know that which another man (in regard of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall impediments) neither doth nor can know, yet the humane nature in every perſon is capable of the ſame, both kind and degree of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is about to reprove the pride of <hi>Job,</hi> as he conceives, and he doth it (as was but now toucht) in ſuch a manner as ſpeaks his owne pride, <hi>What knoweſt thou that we know not,</hi> is the language of a high minde: I am as good and as wiſe as thou: though it may be ſo, yet it is uncomely to ſay ſo.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some in reproving other mens faults, runne into the very ſame faults themſelves;</hi> the reproofe of a fault may not onely be faulty, but the fault which is reproved. A man may reprove pride with much pride, and leſſer vanityes, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of vanity. All that good men ſpeak for good, doth not begin at a principle of goodneſſe; their owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may riſe up againſt the corruptions of others, and ſin is often heard chiding vice. How many are there who check paſſion, with paſſion, and are very angry in diſlike of anger; you ſhall have ſome men ſpeake againſt bitterneſſe of ſpirit with a bitter ſpirit, and while they are taxing their Brethren with making breaches or with an unwillingneſſe to peace, diſcover much unpeaceableneſſe, yea an unwillingneſſe to have thoſe breaches healed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diogenes</hi> was obſerved to trample upon the pride of <hi>Plato</hi> with greater pride; and he who to rebuke pride in Apparrell, wore himſelfe an unhandſome and torne Coate, was rightly told that his pride was ſeene through the holes of his Coate. There may be as much oſtentation in wearing ſordid, as there is in wearing the gayeſt Cloathes. It was a ſhame for Heathens to declare their owne folly, while they declaimed againſt the folly of their neighbours; how ſcandalous then is this in Chriſtians?</p>

                     </note> At ſeventy he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the word which we tranſlate <hi>Gray-headed,</hi> and that was his title till he arrived at <hi>Foureſcore;</hi> from that to the end of life, the whole ſtate was called, <hi>Decrepid old Age;</hi> and they who reached thoſe yeares, were expreſſed by the word which we render <hi>Very aged men,</hi> or as we ſay, <hi>men having one foot in the Grave;</hi> for he that was an hundred yeares old, was not numbred among the living, but among he dead. The Chalde Paraphraſt applyes the diſtinction thus; <hi>With us is Eliphaz, who is gray-headed, and Bildad who is decrepid, and Zophar who is older then thy Father. Hierome</hi> gives <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the precedency in age, affirming that he was the eldeſt Sonne of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and that at the time of this diſpute, he was no leſſe then a hundred and fifty yeares old, <hi>Jobs</hi> Father ninety, and <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe ſeventy. But I ſtay not upon theſe conjectures.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope of <hi>Elipqaz</hi> in theſe words may be reduced to this account: As if he had ſayd, <hi>We need not depend on thy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or antiquity; For with us, that is, on our ſide, or of our party and opinion, there are men gray-headed, yea, very aged, much elder, not onely then thy ſelfe, but, then thy Father. Therefore doe not thou charge us with novelty, know, that we have received our Doctrine from venerable Anceſtors; if thou haſt learned theſe things of thy Father, and drunke in thy opinion from the Aged, ſo have we: Nor doe we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the Tenets of our fore-fathers meerely by the number of dayes which they lived, but by the wiſedome and piety with which they were enriched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is obſervable in Scripture, that <hi>Teman</hi> (from whence <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaz</hi> came) was a famous <hi>Schoole of Learning (Jer.</hi> 49.7.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, is wiſedome no more in Teman?</hi> Hee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48478:20"/> ſpeakes of it, as of a knowne place for knowledge and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; What? <hi>Is wiſedome no more in Teman?</hi> As if we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Is there no more learning at Oxford or Cambridge?</hi> are the lights extinguiſht, and the fountaines dry? Thus <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> aſſerts that his ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From this conteſt about Antiquity and ancient men ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten renewed and ſo much urged betweene <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends. We may obſerve:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That they who have moſt yeares upon their backs, are, or may be ſuppoſed to have moſt knowledge and wiſedome in their heads and hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They who have Antiquity on their ſide, are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they have Truth on their ſide.</hi> That which is indeed moſt ancient is moſt true; yet there are very many very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient untruths: It is no new thing to ſee a gray-headed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and a falſe Doctrine much older then our Fathers.</p>

                     </note> This is a truth, but for the reaſon above, I ſtay not upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Septuagint tranſlation is farre wider then the former, <hi>Thou haſt received but few wounds, in compariſon of the ſinnes that thou haſt committed;</hi> which is a Paraphraſe, not a tranſlation, and ſuch a Paraphraſe as ſeemes to lye quite without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the text: The meaning and intendment of it may be given thus; as if he had ſayd, <hi>Thou complaineſt that thou art great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted, that thy ſorrowes are innumerable,</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>but if thou conſidereſt thy great and many ſinnes, thy ſufferings are few, yea, thy ſufferings may rather be called conſolations, and thy loſſes gaines: Are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of God ſmall to thee, ſeeing thou haſt ſinned ſo much?</hi> When God layes but a little affliction upon ſinfull man, he may be ſayd, to give a great deale of mercy.</p>
                  <p>A third gives this ſenſe,<note place="margin">An conſolatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Dei tam contemptibiles judicas ut pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jiciat eas ante blaſphematores.</note> 
                     <hi>Are the conſolations of God ſmall to thee?</hi> That is, Doeſt thou eſteeme the conſolations of God ſo cheape, that he will give them to ſuch a one as thou? or that hee will laviſh them out upon the wicked, and caſt theſe Pearles to Swine, to ſuch as are blaſphemers and contemners of God?</p>
                  <p>But why doth <hi>Eliphaz</hi> call theſe the conſolations of God? Did God adminiſter them to <hi>Job</hi> with his owne hand, or did he ſpeake to <hi>Job</hi> from Heaven? Some conceive that though he and his Freinds ſpake them, yet <hi>Eliphaz</hi> calls them the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God, by an <hi>Hebraiſme,</hi> becauſe he judged them great conſolations. Thus in Scripture, <hi>The Mountaine of God,</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Conſolations of God</hi> are two-fold:

                        <item>Firſt, Ariſing from good things already exhibited to us.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Conſolations of God in this place, are good things promiſed, or offered: <hi>Promiſes are Divine conveyances of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> The Freinds of <hi>Job</hi> had made him many promiſes, that he repenting, <hi>God would make his latter end better then his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> &amp;c. Hence <hi>Eliphaz</hi> tells him that he had ſlighted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48478:21"/> of God. Any man who reads his ſtory may wonder why he ſhould: Surely <hi>Job</hi> was not in caſe to refuſe comfort, conſidering how he was ſtript of all comfort. <hi>The full ſoule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed loatheth the honey Combe, but to the hungry ſoule, every bitter thing is ſweet;</hi> that is, thoſe things which dainty palates di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt, he eates very ſavourly. <hi>Job</hi> was kept ſhort and low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he had nothing of conſolation left, either without or within; he was poore and ſore without, he was full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and terrour within: the arrowes of the Almighty had even drunk up his ſpirit, and layd all his comforts waſt, and doth he yet neglect or undervalue comforts? 'Tis true, he had reall conſolations, as appeares by that profeſſion of his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods favour towards him, <hi>I know that I ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> yet he had no ſenſible conſolations; his frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſhew he had not. So then, the conſolations of God (for eſteeming which little he is reproved) were the promiſes of conſolation made to him in the name of God by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of his Friends. <hi>Are the conſolations of God ſmall unto thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That conſolation is the gift, and proper worke of God. Thou</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 71.21.) <hi>ſhalt encreaſe my greatneſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me on every ſide: The Lord ſhall comfort Sion, he will comfort all he waſt places (Iſ.</hi> 51.3.) And againe, <hi>As one whom his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comforteth, ſo will I comfort you, and you ſhall be comforted in Jeruſalem.</hi> God comforts as a Mother, <hi>tenderly,</hi> and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts as a Father, yea as a Maſter, <hi>effectually,</hi> I will comfort you, and yee ſhall be comforted. As the corrections of God are effectuall, and proſper in the worke for which they are ſent, ſo alſo are his conſolations. <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſayd (<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18.) <hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed.</hi> So every ſoule, whom God comforts, ſhall ſay, <hi>Thou haſt comforted me, and I was comforted.</hi> This the Apoſtle ſpeaks out to the praiſe of God (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3, 4.) <hi>Bleſſed be God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Father of mercies, and the God of all conſolations;</hi> all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs to God; he hath all comfort in his owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and diſpoſe; there is not any creature in the World can give out the leaſt dram of comfort to us without the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or leave of God; it is poſſible for one man to give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man riches, but he cannot give him comfort; man may
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48478:21"/> give honour to man, but he cannot give him comfort. A man may have a pleaſant dwelling, a loving Wife, ſweet Children, and yet none of theſe a comfort to him.</p>
                  <p>The conſolation of all our poſſeſſions and relations is from God: Whoſoever would have comfort, muſt trade to Heaven for it, thats a commodity can be found upon no earthly coaſt, you may fetch in wealth from many coaſts of the earth, but you cannot fetch in comfort, till you addreſſe your ſelves to the God of Heaven. We can procure our owne ſorrow quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but God onely makes us to rejoyce; our releife from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction or inward griefe is the gift of God. <hi>He onely can comfort us in outward afflictions who can command the creature, and he onely can comfort us againſt our inward griefes, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the conſcience.</hi> None can doe either of theſe but God; therefore conſolations are from God. <hi>Luther</hi> ſpake true, <hi>It is eaſier to make a World then to comfort the conſcience;</hi> the Hebrew phraſe to comfort, uſed in diverſe places of the old Teſtament, is, <hi>To ſpeake to the heart:</hi> Now God onely can ſpeake to the heart; man can ſpeake to the eare, he can ſpeake words, but he can goe no further. Therefore the act and art of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting belongs properly to God; <hi>Chriſt is the true Noah: Lamech</hi> ſaith of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 5.29. <hi>This man ſhall comfort us, concerning our worke and the toyle of our hands;</hi> it was not in <hi>Noah</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort but as God made him a comfort, and he was ſaid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as a type of Chriſt, Chriſt is true comfort, <hi>He is comfort cloathed in our fleſh,</hi> he is (as it were) <hi>comfort incarnate: Noah</hi> ſent a Dove out of his Arke, which returned with an Olive branch, Jeſus Chriſt ſends the holy Ghoſt who is called <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi> with the Olive branch of true peace to our wearied ſouls; and to ſhew that it is now the higheſt act of Chriſts love &amp; care as mediator, to give comfort, he promiſed to ſend the holy Ghoſt, when himſelfe was taking his leave of the Church, in regard of any viſible abode or bodily preſence: being ready to aſcend and ſtep into Heaven; he ſayd, <hi>I will ſend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi> When God rained fire and brimſtone from Heaven upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> it is ſayd by ſome of the Ancients, that he ſent a <hi>Hell out of Heaven:</hi> But when he powres the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit from Heaven upon his <hi>Sion,</hi> we may ſay he ſends <hi>a heaven out of heaven.</hi> Heaven above is nothing elſe but holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the comforts of the holy Spirit, are the onely Heaven below.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48478:22"/>
                  <p>How highly then ought we to eſteeme, how carefully to maintaine communion with God, who hath all comfort; ſeeing comfort is more to us then all we have. If wee have comfort, let our eſtate be what it will we are well enough; comfort is as the ſpring of our yeare, as the light of our day, as the Sun in our Firmament, as the life of our lives. Have we not reaſon then to draw, yea, to preſſe neerer unto God, who hath all comfort in his hand, and without whom the beſt things cannot comfort us? Not our riches, nor our relations, not Wife, nor Children, not health, nor beauty, not credit nor honour, none of theſe can comfort us without God, and if God pleaſe he can make any thing comfort us; he can make a cruſt of dry bread a feaſt of fat things, a cup of cold water, a banquet of Wine to us. And as he can make our comforts croſſes, ſo our croſſe a comfort, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4.) <hi>Thy rod and thy ſtaffe comfort me,</hi> not onely the ſupporting ſtaffe, but the correcting rod ſhall comfort, if God command it to be a comforter: Who would not maintaine communion with this God who can make a comfort of any thing, who can anſwer every croſſe with a comfort; <hi>If we have a thouſand croſſes, God hath ten thouſand comforts;</hi> hee can multiply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts faſter then the World can multiply croſſes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if God be the God of all conſolation, <hi>then goe to God for conſolation;</hi> as the Angel ſaid to the women when they came to the Sepulcher enquiring for Chriſt, <hi>Why ſeek yee the living among the dead, he is riſen, he is not here:</hi> So I may ſay, <hi>Why ſeek yee living comforts among dead or dying creatures; Seeke them there no longer. Job</hi> complaines in this Booke, <hi>When I ſayd my bed ſhall comfort me, then thou ſcareſt me with dreames (Chap.</hi> 7.) <hi>Job</hi> went to a wrong place, when he went to his bed for comfort; moſt ſoules miſſe of comfort, becauſe they goe to a wrong place for it: one goes to his bed, another to his freind for comfort, a third to his wife and Children, theſe, ſaith he, ſhall comfort me; alas, why ſeeke yee the living among the dead, none of theſe can comfort, though theſe may be meanes of comfort. <hi>Who or whatſoever is the inſtrument, God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all our comfort; whatſoever hand brings it, God ſends it; God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) who comforteth thoſe who are caſt downe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted us by the comming of Titus</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.6.) <hi>Titus</hi> was a good man and brought good tydings, yet <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48478:22"/> the comming of <hi>Titus</hi> did not comfort them; but, ſaith <hi>Paul, God comforted us by the comming of Titus;</hi> Tis not your freind who comforts you, but God who comforts you by the comming of ſuch a freind, when you are in ſorrow; by ſending in ſuch reliefe, when you are poor; by ſending ſuch medicines, when you are ſick, ſuch ſalves when you are ſore, ſuch counſell when you are in doubt and know not what to doe.</p>
                  <p>Once more, <hi>It is happy for Saints that conſolation is in the hand of God;</hi> if it were in the hand of the creature, ſure they ſhould have but little of it, but it is in the hand of God. There are theſe foure conſiderations which may comfort Saints, that comfort is in the hand of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſidering his nature, he is willing and ready to do good; he is full of compaſſion, and to ſhew mercy pleaſeth him more then it releeveth us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſidering his relation to his people: he is a Father. Will a Father let a Child lye comfortleſſe, when he can help him? he is our Husband, he is our Freind, all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions provoke God to give out comfort to the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſidering his Omniſcience and Omnipreſence; he knowes where the ſhooe wrings, he knowes what comfort we want; a freind (poſſibly) hath the comfort in his hand, which we need, and he may be willing to give it out unto us, but he knowes not wherein we are pinched; God tells <hi>Moſes, I have ſeen, I have ſeen the afflictions of my people in Aegypt.</hi> And as he knows how it is with us, ſo we are ever within his reach, he can lay his hand upon every joynt where wee are pained, and put a Plaſter upon every wound: here is our happineſſe. Chriſt would take off his people from extraordinary cares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of the World, by this argument, <hi>Your Father knowes that ye have need of theſe things, Matth.</hi> 6.32. your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who <hi>carryes the purſe</hi> knowes your want.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider his Omnipotence, he is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; he can command, yea create comforts, he can bring his comforts through an army of ſorrowes to a poore ſoule, yea he can leade comfort through an Army of Devils and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, to a poore ſoule; he is Almighty, there is nothing too hard for him to doe, nor is he hard to be entreated to doe that which gives eaſe unto his people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve:</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48478:23"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſolations rightly adminiſtred by men, are the conſolations of God:</hi> While man ſpeakes, God commands; <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, ſpeake comfortably to Jeruſalem, tell her that her war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is accompliſhed, and her ſin pardoned (Iſa.</hi> 40.1.) As all the counſells, reproofes, and Doctrines which the Miniſters of Chriſt diſpenſe according to the forme of wholeſome words delivered either in the Law or Goſpel, are the counſels, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, reproofs and Doctrins of God; ſo alſo are their conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And thats the reaſon why God takes it ſo ill at the hands of men, when his Meſſengers, who bring either inſtruction, or conſolation, are refuſed; becauſe himſelfe is refuſed when they are, and his conſolations are diſeſteemed when theirs are.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To account the conſolations of God ſmall, is a very great ſinne: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> rebukes rebellious <hi>Korah</hi> and his confederates, for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing the priviledge which they (as Levites) had to be neer God in holy Services (<hi>Numb.</hi> 16.9.) <hi>Seemeth it a ſmall thing unto you, that the God of Iſrael, hath ſeparated you from the Congregation of Iſrael, to bring you neere to himſelfe to doe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Tabernacle?</hi> &amp;c. If it were their ſin to count it a ſmall thing to be called neer to God in holy adminiſtrations, how great a ſin is it in any man to count it a ſmall thing, that God draws neer to him with heavenly conſolations? Though the conſolations of God to us be ſmall comparatively to what ſome others have, yet we muſt not account any conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God ſmall; and that upon two grounds:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe of our owne unworthineſſe; the leaſt conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are great, conſidering how little we are, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpeaks, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10.) <hi>I am not worthy the leaſt of all thy mercies:</hi> Hee thought little mercies too big for him, becauſe he was little in his owne eyes, They who have great, yea any thoughts of their owne merits, leſſen the mercies of God; but hee who ſees he deſerves nothing but ill, ſees abundance of mercy in the ſmalleſt good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Smalleſt conſolations are very great, becauſe they proceed from a great God. As no ſin is ſmall, though comparatively to another ſin, it may be ſmall, becauſe it is committed againſt the great God; ſo no conſolation is ſmall becauſe it comes from the <hi>great God.</hi> God puts an impreſſe of his owne greatneſſe upon the leaſt things that are done or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48478:23"/> given by him; though he give but a peny, yet it hath the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſuperſcription <hi>of him, our infinite and eternall Caeſar:</hi> therefore ſee you ſlight it not. As a good heart is carefull to performe the leaſt duty, and to avoyd the leaſt ſin, or as a good heart calls no duty little, which God enjoynes nor ſin little which God forbids, ſo a good heart is thankfull for the leaſt mercy, and calls no conſolation ſmall, which God, the great God ſends.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That great afflictions take away the ſenſe of tendered mercies;</hi> Conſolations for the matter were offered unto <hi>Job,</hi> but his palate was ſo diſtempered with the gall and wormewood of his afflictions, that he could not taſte them. <hi>Phineas</hi> his Wife regarded not the joyfull newes, that ſhee had brought forth a Man Child, while ſhe was overwhelmed with ſorrow, that the Arke of God was taken. While the Iſraelites were under hard Taske-Maſters in Aegypt, they could not attend to the voice of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who told them of deliverance; their troubles and burdens wert ſo heavy, that they looked upon <hi>Moſes</hi> as a trouble, or as a burden, when hee came to mediate their releaſe. And as the Idolatrous Iſraelites who ſacrificed their Children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> beat up Drumms, and uſed loud-ſounding-Inſtruments, to drowne the cry of the poore Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they might not be heard; ſo ſome afflictions cry ſo loud, and many cry ſo loud in their afflictions, that they drowne the ſweet melody and muſick of thoſe conſolations that are ſounded in their eares. Great complaints render great conſolations ſmall; <hi>Job</hi> was not without ſome blame in this, for though his patience was great, yet had it beene greater, he might have miſſed this reproofe from his Friends, <hi>Are the conſolations of God ſmall to thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And is there any ſecret thing with thee?</q>
                  <p>The meaning appeares thus,<note place="margin">Et verbum la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens tecum. <hi>Heb.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Are the conſolations of God which we have offered ſmall unto thee, becauſe thou haſt ſome ſecret hidden thing in thy breaſt:</hi> This ſecret thing is opened three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in reference to comfort, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Haſt thou ſome ſecret comfort beſides what we have offered, haſt thou conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy owne, which cauſe thee to neglect the conſolations of God?</hi> As in the Goſpell, when the Diſciples <hi>prayed Chriſt to eate,</hi> he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48478:24"/> told them, <hi>I have meat to eate that ye know not of (John</hi> 4.31, 32.) Chriſt had ſecret bread,<note place="margin">

                        <p>
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> Occulium ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum incantatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem vel menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium denotat.</p>
                     </note> his work was his food, <hi>My meat is to doe the will of him that ſent me:</hi> So here, What? haſt thou meate which we know not of? Some <hi>hidden Manna</hi> beyond what wee have told thee of, that thou careſt not for our proviſions?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, others give the meaning thus, <hi>Haſt thou ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conceit of thy owne wiſedome, above ours?</hi> Or is there ſome unknowne worth in thee, that exempts thee from this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule, or way of comfort; Doeſt thou ſo abound in thy owne ſenſe, that thou haſt no need of our Notions? Is all we ſpeake below thee?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are ſuppoſed to aime at ſome ſecret ſinne or guilt, which hindered and unfitted <hi>Job</hi> to take in their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls and conſolations, till it were purged out, or vomited up by ſound repentance.</p>
                  <p>So one renders the Text, <hi>Doth any thing hide them with thee?</hi> The word ſignifies to hide and cover (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.4.) <hi>David covered his face:</hi> ſo here, doth ſomewhat hide, wrap up, and cover theſe conſolations that thou canſt not receive them? or what vayles the eye of thy minde, that thou canſt not behold what we hold out to thee, or not finde out the meaning of it? <hi>If our Goſpell be hid</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it is hid to thoſe that are loſt, in whom the God of this World hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the eyes of them,</hi> &amp;c. (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4.) Thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeemes to beſpeake <hi>Job. If the conſolations of God be ſmall to thee,</hi> doth not ſomewhat blinde thy eyes? Doth not ſome cloud hide them from thee? Doth not prejudice againſt us, or ſome cloſe ſin in thy ſelfe interrupt thy ſight?</p>
                  <p>This is hinted by the old Latine Tranſlator, who ſaith, <hi>Thy evill words (or the evill matter that is in thee) hinder this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of the Rabbins gloſſeth it thus, and the Originall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it, <hi>Some lye, ſome inchantment, or witchery hath ſeized upon thee, though thou pretendeſt truth.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeakes to this ſenſe (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not receive the truth:</hi> Witchery or Inchantment gives a ſecret wound. <hi>Is there any ſecret thing with thee?</hi> Haſt thou any ſecret comfort for thy ſelfe, any ſecret conceit of thy ſelfe, any ſecret ſinne in thy boſome hindering the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all working, or due prizing of thoſe cordialls which we have given thee?</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:48478:24"/>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe ſecret things never ſtands in the way of receiving conſolation; he that hath hidden comfort in him, will not refuſe ſpoken comforts; nor doe I thinke that <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> aymed at that, unleſſe in ſcorne, as ſome reſolve it:<note place="margin">Malo in bonum ſumi, licet hoc in eum <hi>Eliphaz</hi> dicat, eum ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> but rather at one of or both the latter, though miſtaken in both. Yet his ſuſpition gives us a ground for theſe two Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That a man who is full of his owne wiſedome, is not fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction, counſell, or conſolation from others;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Intus exiſtens prohibet alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> 
                     <hi>that which is within hinders that which comes from without:</hi> When a man thinks himſelfe wiſer then his teachers, he will not be taught, nor learne wiſedome by them. Some might have knowne much, if they had not preſumed they knew enough. There is no greater impediment of knowledge, then an opinion of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>A ſinne kept cloſe, or ſecret within us, hinders the effect and working of the Word:</hi> Though comforts, and counſels are given, they will not operate, where ſecret corruption lyes at heart; the filthineſſe and corruption of the ſtomach, hinders digeſtion, till it be purged out: Phyſitians remove ill humours before they preſcribe Cordialls, elſe they doe but nouriſh the diſcaſe. 'Tis ſo in Spiritualls; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives the rule (1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all guile, hypocriſie, and envy, and evill ſpeaking, as new born Babes deſire the ſincere milke of the Word, that yee may grow thereby.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Till you caſt out theſe, you will never thrive under the Word; if a man be to ſow Seed in his Garden, he will pull up the Weeds, and throw away the Stones, elſe the Seed will not ſpring up to perfection. The Prophet tells the Jewes (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5, 25.) <hi>Your ſins hinder good things from you:</hi> as ſin hinders good from comming to us, ſo it hinders the Word from working good in us. Though the proper buſineſſe of the Word be to caſt out, or pull up this ſecret ſin, yet there is a great ſtop given it while any ſecret ſin is nouriſhed, or not caſt out. That's the reaſon why ſo many precious promiſes take not upon the heart, ſome ſin, ſome corruption obſtructs their operation; and (like the theefe in the Candle) waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away their ſtrength and light.</p>
                  <p>As the Lord ſayd to <hi>Joſhua</hi> when the people of Iſrael fled before the men of <hi>Ai, There is ſome accurſed thing among you, therefore they cannot ſtand before their Enemies.</hi> So I may ſay,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48478:25"/> when any ſtand up againſt the Word of God, or reſiſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations which are offered them; ſure there is ſome accurſed thing, ſome hidden Wedge of ſtolne Gold, or ſome Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Garment treaſured in, or wrapt about your hearts, and therefore yee can neither ſee nor ſubmit to the counſells of God for your good.</p>
                  <p>This is a uſefull truth for us, though an undue charge on <hi>Job;</hi> and yet his Freind proceeds (if a higher charge can be) to charge him higher, as will appeare in the two Verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

                  <p>Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> following one of the Rabbins, preſents us with a different tranſlation from either of theſe, <hi>What Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine can thy heart give thee,</hi> or <hi>what can thy heart teach thee?</hi> The word which we render to take, to carry, or hold up a thing, ſignifies alſo to learne or teach Doctrine, but rather to learne then to teach, as Grammarians tell us, which ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the cleareneſſe of that verſion; yet the Chalde Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe followes the ſame ſenſe, <hi>What hath thy owne thought taught thee?</hi> What learneſt thou there, as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſayd, <hi>Thou haſt an evill heart, and ſurely an ill Maſter will teach but ill Doctrine;</hi> when <hi>the heart is inditing of a good matter (Pſal.</hi> 45.) then we may learne good leſſons from the heart: and then we ſpeake moſt effectually to the hearts of others, when we ſpeak from our owne hearts, they having firſt been ſpoken to by the ſpirit of God. But a corrupt heart can teach no better then it hath, and that is corrupt Doctrines. Theſe are truths, yet too much ſtrained for upon this Text, and therefore I paſſe from them, and abide by the ordinary ſignification of the word as we read it, <hi>Why doth thy heart take thee up, or carry thee away;</hi> as if he had ſayd, Thy heart hath ſeized upon thee, and arreſted thee, thou art led away priſoner, or captive by the violence and impetuouſneſſe of thy owne ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The word is applyed (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.14.) to the motion of the ſpirit of God, ſent unto <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to inſtruct him; <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit lifted me up, or caught me away;</hi> that which the good ſpirit did unto <hi>Ezekiel</hi> (not onely upon his ſpirit, but upon his body, for hee was corporally carryed away from the place where he was) that the heart of <hi>Job</hi> (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> conceived) did unto him, it lifted him up, and carryed him away. There is a kind of violence in the allurements and inticings of the heart. As a man is ſayd to be carryed away by the ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of others, ſo alſo by his owne.</p>
                  <p>In the former ſenſe the word is uſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.25, Where <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſing to take heed of the Harlot, ſaith he, <hi>Keep thee from the evill Woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a ſtrange Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; luſt not after her in thy heart, neither let her take thee with her eye lids:</hi> There he makes uſe of this word, let her not take
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48478:26"/> thee, or let her not carry thee away upon her eye lids, let not her wanton eye flatter thee to the ſin of wantonneſſe and uncleanneſſe. As the eye of a whoriſh Woman, ſo the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh heart of a man, often takes and carryeth him away.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The heart hath power over, and is too hard for the whole Man;</hi> Paſſions hurry our hearts, and our hearts hurry us; and who can tell whither his heart will carry him, or where it will ſet him downe, when once it hath taken him up. This is certaine, it will carry every man beyond the bounds of his duty, both to God and man: Take it more diſtinctly in theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <p>The heart quickly carryeth us beyond the bounds of grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the heart often carryeth us beyond the bounds of reaſon; <hi>When paſſion workes much, reaſon workes not at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it may carry us beyond the bounds of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, yea of modeſty: 'Tis very dangerous to commit our ſelves to the conduct of paſſion; that (unleſſe kept under good command) will ſoone run us beyond the line both of Modeſty and of Honeſty, of Reaſon, and of Grace. He that is carryed away thus farre muſt make a long journey of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, before he can return and come back, either to God or to himſelfe. Some have been carryed viſibly away by the Devil, by an evill ſpirit without them (if God give commiſſion or permiſſion, the Devill can eaſily doe it) very many are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away by the evill ſpirit within them. An evill heart is as bad as the Devill; the evill ſpirit without, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſpirit within, carry us both the ſame way, and that is quite out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Conſider further how the heart carryeth us away, even from ſpirituall duties and holy ſervices; and this is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the caſe of carnall men (who are given up to their hearts luſts) but of the Saints; their hearts are continually lifting at them, and ſometimes they are carryed quite away from Prayer, and from hearing the Word: the heart lifts the man up, and ſteales him out of the Congregation, while his body remaines there, the body ſits ſtill, but the minde, which is the man, is gone, either about worldly buſineſſe and deſignes, or about worldly pleaſures and delights. He ſtirres not a foot, nor moves a finger, and yet he is carryed all the World over:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48478:26"/> He viſits both the Indies, yet ſteps not over his own threſhold. Thus the heart being carryed away, carryeth the man away. And thats the reaſon why God calls ſo earneſtly,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, This winking with the eye, is expounded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though not as an oppoſition againſt what he heard, yet as the geſture of a negligent and careleſſe hearer. They who ſpeak, take it ill to have either ill lookes, or not to be looked upon by their hearers. The attentiveneſſe of the eare may be much diſcerned by the eye: One of the old morall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, in his diſcourſe about hearing, numbers <hi>winking</hi> among the vices and offenſive behaviours of a Hearer. When the Lord Chriſt Preached (<hi>Luke</hi> 4.20.) It is ſayd, <hi>That the eyes of all that were in the Synagogue were faſtned on him.</hi> A faſtned eye is the note of a fixed heart, as a wandring eye is of a wandring heart. <hi>They faſtned their eyes upon him,</hi> as if they meant to hear with their eyes as well as with their eares. A winking eye is a moveable and an unſetled eye, and therefore may well be the diſcoverer of an unſetled Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This winking with the eye is alſo a ſigne of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and ſcorne. As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſayd, The pride of thy heart ſparkles at thine eye; while wee are counſelling and comforting thee, thou art ſcorning us. The Ancients were very criticall about the eye, much of a man may be ſeen at his eye. As a man ſees, ſo he is ſeen by his owne eyes. The frame of the heart appeares much in the eye; a joyfull or a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full frame of heart, an humble or a proud frame of heart, a contented, or diſcontented, an amicable, or a ſcornefull frame of heart appeares at the eye. As the eare and noſtrills of the Horſe, diſcover him moſt, according to the rules of Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, ſo the eye of man is the greateſt diſcoverer of man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the conſtitution or the actions of it. And that this action of <hi>winking,</hi> is an argument of a ſcornefull
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48478:27"/> ſpirit, or the action of a ſcorner, appeares from <hi>Davids</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, or deprecation (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.19.) <hi>Let not them that are mine Enemies wrongfully rejoyce over me, neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cauſe;</hi> it may ſeem to be a ſtrange piece of prayer, why would not <hi>David</hi> have his enemy wink? What was that to him? The meaning is this, let not mine Enemies have any occaſion to ſcorne and deride me, to boaſt and inſult over me.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſins which are very viſible in the eye: The firſt is wantonneſſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>Becauſe the Daughters of Sion are haughty, and walke with ſtretched forth necks, and wanton eyes,</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>Deceiving with their eye;</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.14. gives this character of ſome, <hi>They have eyes full of adultery,</hi> you may perceive the filthines and uncleanneſſe of their hearts ſtaring out of their eyes. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſin which is ſo viſible in the eye, is <hi>Pride; Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of a proud look (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.17.) <hi>Six things ths Lord hateth; yea, ſeven are an abomination to him;</hi> And the firſt of the ſeven, is, <hi>A proud looke;</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>Haughty eyes:</hi> Pride and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe are ſeated, yea, conſpicuouſly enthroned in the eye.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Theſe words, <hi>Why winkeſt thou with thine eye?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ad ſimulatam quandam inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiae ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem &amp; ſanctitatis ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen, quod hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſm redolet referri poteſt.</note> are expounded as a reproofe of hypocriſie and ſeeming holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſayd, Thou lookeſt very demurely, and innocently, as if (according to our old Proverbe) <hi>Butter would not melt in thy mouth,</hi> or as if thou wert ſpeaking familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God. For as lifting up the eyes or looking to Heaven is a geſture of holy worſhip. (<hi>John</hi> 17.1.) <hi>Then Jeſus lift up his eyes to Heaven:</hi> So alſo is winking with the eye. It is very uſuall with many to ſhut or wink with their eyes in prayer, that ſo their ſpirits may be more compoſed, and freer from diſtraction. 'Tis not unlikely that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> obſerved <hi>Job</hi> wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his eyes, as if he had ſet himſelfe to ſeeke God; this provoked him, What? ſuch a one as thou, a hypocrite, a wicked man, what thou goe to God? Wilt thou wink with thy eyes, as if thou wert wrapt up in ſome Divine medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas we have ground rather to conclude that thou art deviſing miſchiefe: There are two Texts in the Proverbs, which give ſome light to this Interpretation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.13. <hi>He winketh with his eye, he ſpeaketh with his feet, teacheth with his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48478:28"/> fingers, frowardneſſe is in his heart, he deviſeth miſchiefe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: Solomon</hi> puts a winking eye and a froward miſchiefe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing heart together: As if he had ſayd, A wicked man (for of him he ſpeakes in the former Verſe) winkes with the eye, as if he had ſome high rapture, whereas his minde is ſet upon miſcheife, and purſuing the worſt of evills. Againe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.10. <hi>He that winketh with his eye cauſeth ſorrow;</hi> but how doth a man that winketh with the eye cauſe ſorrow? what depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is there betweene theſe two, ſorrow, and winking, that the one ſhould cauſe the other? Theſe words, <hi>he that winketh with his eye,</hi> are the deſcription of a <hi>deceitfull man;</hi> ſuch a one may cauſe ſorrow enough,<note place="margin">Qui annuit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo ſuo cum fraude.</note> both to himſelfe and others. <hi>Solomon</hi> intends, not a ſimple, but a ſubtill ſly winking with the eye; and ſo the Syriake readeth it; <hi>He who winketh with his eye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, cauſeth ſorrow:</hi> Deceit makes the deceived ſorrowfull, and it will make the Deceiver ſorrowfull; he muſt either be ſorrowfull to repentance, or feele the ſorrow of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This winking with the eye, is conceived to be a metaphor taken from thoſe who ſhoot with Guns or Bowes,<note place="margin">Quid colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant oculi tui, <hi>Jun. Metaphora a jaculatoribus ſumpta.</hi> id.</note> Gunners and Archers winke when they ſhoot, that they may take aime the better: The contracting of the ſight, ſtrengthens it. So here, <hi>What doſt thou wink at?</hi> that is, what doſt thou aime at? The eye of a mans minde aimes at ſome marke in meditation, and hence it is uſuall for a man in vehement me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, to wink with his eye. As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſayd, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou haſt ſome great deſigne, ſome grand plot in thy braine, thou pretendeſt to ſome deep wiſedome, or unheard of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; thou haſt ſet up ſome faire marke before thy fancie, and thou wilt be ſure to hit it; what is it that thou aymeſt at? We finde the phraſe uſed in this ſenſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.30. <hi>He ſhutteth his eye to deviſe froward things, moving his lips he bringeth evill to paſſe;</hi> he ſhutteth his eyes, as if hee would make his thoughts more ſteddy and fixt, to hit or reach that froward device which he is caſting about how he may effect. And as a wicked man ſhuts his eyes to deviſe froward, that is, ſinfull things, ſo a good man ſhuts his eyes (leſt variety of objects ſhould divert or call off his minde) when he is deviſing and ſtudying what is beſt both for himſelfe and others.<note place="margin">Et quaſi mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na cogitans at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonitos habes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As if he had ſayd, In ſtead of humbling thy ſelfe under the puniſhment of thy ſin, thou with an incenſed minde conteſteſt againſt God himſelfe: and though while he ſaith <hi>againſt God,</hi> he doth not meane God directly, but God in his judgements and counſells in his Word or in his Workes; yet this is a very high charge, one of the higheſt that is in the whole Booke, but very unjuſt.

                  <q>Thou turneſt thy Spirit againſt God.</q>
                  <p>There is a twofold turning the ſpirit againſt God:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Naturall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. Enmity is the turning of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48478:29"/> ſpirit. The wiſedome or luſt of the fleſh is enmity againſt God.</p>

                     </note>The Hebrew is, <hi>Thou makeſt thy ſpirit to returne to God,</hi> which is expounded two wayes; firſt, thou makeſt thy ſpirit to turn upon, or againſt God: Secondly, thy ſpirit anſwers or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth upon God; both meet in one meaning; for though there may be a turning away of the ſpirit without anſwering, yet (in one ſenſe) all anſwers are the turning of our ſpirit: if any man aske a queſtion, the anſwer is the returne of his minde who makes the anſwer, ſo ſome render, <hi>Why doth thy ſpirit returne anſwer to God;</hi> as if he rebuked him for his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in replying. Thy ſpirit returnes upon God, if he ſpeak one word, thou wilt have two; in that ſenſe the word is uſed, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.9. where the Apoſtle giving rules (among other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) to Servants, charges them, <hi>Servants be obedient to your owne Maſters, and pleaſe them well in all things, not anſwering againe.</hi> But, is it a fault for a Servant, when asked a queſtion, to make an anſwer? no, it were a fault not to anſwer. The meaning is, that a Servant being reproved for a fault muſt not anſwer; that is, his ſpirit muſt not riſe, and returne againſt his Maſter; or if a Servant be directed to doe any warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worke, he muſt not <hi>anſwer againe;</hi> that is, hee muſt not contradict or murmure at the orders which he hath received, but addreſſe himſelfe to the fulfilling of them; this is the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering againe,</hi> reproved as a fault in Servants, which is <hi>rather gain ſaying then anſwering,</hi> as we put in the Margent of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: in which ſenſe, anſwering is taken here according to this interpretation. Thy ſpirit anſwers God, or turnes againſt him. We may cleare it alſo by that of the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20.) Where having ſhewed the abſolute ſoveraignty of God in his Decrees and purpoſes, by the example of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as alſo by that of <hi>Pharoah:</hi> He concludes, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſoreſaw that this Doctrine would rayſe a great deale of duſt, and cauſe many to turne their ſpirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, which he thus repreſents (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 19.) <hi>Thou wilt ſay unto me, Why doth he yet finde fault? for who hath reſiſted his will?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48478:29"/> Nay, but O man who art thou that replyeſt againſt God?</hi> What? wilt thou chop logick with God himſelf?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Spirit</hi> is here put for the will, thoughts, and counſells,<note place="margin">Spiritus pro arrogantia.

                  <p>Beſides, <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſometimes put for indignation, for fury, and wrath; in all which acceptions, the word may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred here, <hi>Thou turneſt thy ſpirit,</hi> that is, thy anger and wrath, thy fury and indignation againſt God. So the word is uſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.4. <hi>When the ſpirit, or blaſt of the terrible ones, is as a ſtorme againſt the Wall;</hi> that is, while the fury of the terrible ones is in its higheſt march and motion, God promiſeth to be a ſtrength to the poore, a ſtrength and a refuge to the needy in his diſtreſſe: So <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.11. <hi>A foole uttereth all his minde, or all his ſpirit;</hi> that is, all his anger, he lets it out, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himſelfe preſently; but <hi>a wiſe man</hi> (if there be cauſe of anger) <hi>keepeth it in till afterwards;</hi> that is, till a fit ſeaſon. He hath a retentive faculty which a Foole hath not. Now, in which ſenſe ſoever of theſe explained, we underſtand <hi>Spirit</hi> in the preſent Text, the charge is as high as it can goe upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, when 'tis ſayd, Hee turneth his Spirit againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To turne the ſpirit againſt God is the very ſpirit of ungodlineſſe;</hi> there is no greater wickedneſſe then this.

The Vulgar Latine tranſlates it well, <hi>Why doth thy ſpirit ſwell againſt God,</hi> Thou haſt an impoſtumation in thy ſpirit againſt God; yea it is not onely an act of the proudeſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48478:30"/> pride, but of the <hi>maddeſt madneſſe</hi> to turne the ſpirit againſt God;<note place="margin">Furorem eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſti ante domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. <hi>Sept.</hi>
                     </note> ſo the Septuagint gives it, <hi>Thou haſt cauſed thy fury or thy madneſſe to breake forth before God;</hi> he that acts againſt God is a mad man indeed, <hi>Will yee provoke the Lord, are you ſtronger then he?</hi> is the Apoſtles chiding queſtion to ſuch mad men: are you ſo mad after your luſts, hath ſin made you ſo fooliſh, <hi>Have you loſt both grace and reaſon at once?</hi> that you dare thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord, and challenge the Almighty? <hi>God reſiſts the proud,</hi> and the proud aſſault him; Grace turnes the ſpirit to God, repentance is the returne of our ſpirits to God; then what is the turning of our ſpirits againſt God, but a cleare demonſtration of a totally impenitent and graceleſſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</p>
                  <p>Againe, when <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith, <hi>Job turned his Spirit againſt God,</hi> he doth not meane it of a direct or profeſſed oppoſition againſt God, as if <hi>Job</hi> had openly defied him, and blaſphemed his Name; but his meaning is, that <hi>Job</hi> ſhewing ſo much impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and unſatisfiedneſſe of ſpirit, under the dealings of God with him, did not ſubmit to God, as he ought. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (I conceive) did not ſo much as ſuſpect that <hi>Job</hi> turned his ſpirit immediately, or as wee ſay, <hi>poynt blanke</hi> againſt God himſelfe, but onely againſt his diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That while we ſpeake, or our hearts riſe up againſt the dealings of God with our ſelves or others, we may be ſayd to turne our ſpirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God himſelfe:</hi> Many who think they have not neglected Chriſt, will be found to have neglected him, becauſe they have neglected thoſe by whom, or that wherein Chriſt is offered. The Evangeliſt brings in Chriſt ſpeaking thus (<hi>Matth.</hi> 25.) <hi>I was hungry and yee fed me not, thirſty and yee gave me no drinke;</hi> they to whom hee ſpeakes wonder at this, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſay they) <hi>when ſaw we thee hungry and gave thee no meat, or thirſty and gave thee no drinke,</hi> ſurely we have not been guilty of ſuch a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe: Yea, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>In as much as yee did it not to one of theſe, yee did it not to me;</hi> when yee refuſed to feed theſe, yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to feed me, I was in theſe, and theſe were in me. Now in the ſame manner many will ſay, when wee charge them with <hi>turning their ſpirits againſt God, with fighting againſt, and oppoſing God:</hi> Who? we oppoſe God? we never oppoſed God as we know of; yea, peradventure, they will ſay, we have honoured
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48478:30"/> God, and doe you charge us that we have turned our ſpirit againſt God? to many ſuch God will ſay, In as much as yee oppoſed my word, and murmured againſt my workes, in as much as yee were angry with my diſpenſations, and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with what I have done, ye have turned your ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. We may become guilty of this ſin before we thinke of it; for as there is a direct and litterall contending with God, ſo an equivalent, or conſtructive contending with him. As ſome men commit plaine open Treaſon againſt a State, but others commit only <hi>conſtructive Treaſon:</hi> 'Tis ſo here, the God of Heaven knowes when ſpirits turne againſt him directly, and when by conſequence, and he will take vengeance not onely of direct and avowed, but alſo of conſequentiall and conſtructive Treaſon againſt his Soveraignty, unleſſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender repent and be humbled before him. He will judge thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands at the laſt day, for oppoſing him, who, it may be, in ſome things have pleaded for him; yea, who have in ſome things not onely acted, but ſuffered for him; though uſually when the ſpirit of any man turneth againſt God, that mans workes and words turne againſt him too: So <hi>Eliphaz</hi> further taxeth <hi>Job</hi> in the latter clauſe of the Verſe.</p>
                  <q>And letteſt ſuch words goe out of thy mouth?</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſayd, <hi>Such ſtuffe as thou haſt in thy heart, even ſuch flowes out of thy mouth;</hi> the word <hi>Such</hi> is added by moſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators; the Hebrew is, <hi>And letteſt words goe out of thy mouth;</hi> it is no fault to let words goe out of the mouth: 'tis no ſin to ſpeak, but to ſpeak ſuch or ſuch words, may be very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and therefore we, and others, for explication ſake,<note place="margin">

For as when <hi>Ezra</hi> would deſcribe a deliverance in the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilty of it beyond words, he doth not tell us what it was, but ſaith onely, <hi>Seeing our God hath given us ſuch deliverance as this, (Ez.</hi> 9.13.) So when <hi>Eliphaz</hi> would deſcribe words in the vanity or ſinfulneſſe of them below words, he doth not tell us what they were, but ſaith onely, <hi>Such words as theſe;</hi> yet
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48478:31"/> poſſibly the words he meanes were theſe, <hi>Why haſt thou ſet me as a marke, ſo that I am a burden to my ſelfe (Chap.</hi> 7.20.) or theſe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.30.) <hi>If I waſh me with Snow water, and make my hands never ſo cleare, yet thou wilt plunge me in the ditch,</hi> or theſe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.26.) <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and thou makeſt me to poſſeſſe the iniquities of my youth:</hi> Theſe, or ſuch as theſe, were the words which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> leaves under this note of diſdaine, <hi>Such words.</hi> Yet theſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſhould have mollified with a charitable conſtruction, and not have ſharpned his owne tongue againſt them, much leſſe ſhould he have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted them, as the turning of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For as ſome draw neer to God with their lips, and give him ſmooth words, while their hearts are farre from him, and their ſpirits turned againſt him: So others may ſeeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God with their lips, and give him harſh language, while their hearts are neere, and their ſpirits cleave unto him.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall further give you a fourfold character of theſe words, ſutable to the miſpriſion which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his Friends had of him all along. Such words, or words ſo apprehended, muſt needs ſound harſhly in their eares, and in the cares of any man fearing God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Proud words of himſelfe,</hi> inſiſting upon his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe as they conceived, for in the next words <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith, <hi>What is man that he ſhould be cleane?</hi> they thought <hi>Job</hi> ſpake much to paint and bedeck himſelfe with his own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and innocency.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Blaſphemous words of God,</hi> though not directly, yet by conſequence, againſt his works and dealings.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Reproachfull, ſcornefull words againſt them,</hi> as if they were neither able nor worthy to be his counſell; <hi>You are the men, and wiſedome ſhall dye with you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Falſe words upon the whole matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, maintaining (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> judged) contrary to the truth; that he was not puniſhed for his ſin. Words under this four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold notion are reproveable and ſinfull enough; ſuch <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> eſteemed the words of <hi>Job</hi> to be, proud, blaſphemous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull, falſe, <hi>Why letteſt thou ſuch words as theſe goe out of thy mouth?</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Note:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our words are ſutable to our ſpirits;</hi> ſome can diſſemble much, and ſpeak golden words, while themſelves are droſſe; but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, our words are ſuch as we are: <hi>The vile perſon will ſpeake villany, (Iſa.</hi> 32.6.) A man that is all for the World, ſpeakes worldly (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.5.) <hi>They are of the World, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeake they of the World.</hi> Every man is of the World ſo, as that he is a part of the World, but ſome are ſo of the World, that the World is all them; they who are thus of the World muſt needs ſpeake of the World if they ſpeak any thing, for they have nothing elſe to ſpeake of. Thus a covetous man ſpeakes covetouſly, and a proud man proudly (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 43.2.) Some told the Prophet to his face, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt falſly, the Lord our God hath not ſent thee to ſay, Goe not into Aegypt to ſojourne there;</hi> Theſe were proud words indeed, but who ſpake them? The text tells us, <hi>Then ſpake Azariah the Son of Hoſhaniah, and all the proud men:</hi> The proud men ſpake proudly; ſo on the contrary, a ſober man will ſpeake ſoberly, an humble man humbly; <hi>The poore ſpeake ſupplications,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon;</hi> rich men ſpeake their commands, poore men ſpeake their wiſhes and deſires.</p>

                     <hi>He that dares to ſpeake evill, is arrived at a great height of evill: Eliphaz</hi> puts this as an effect of a <hi>heart turned againſt God; ſuch words as theſe,</hi> ſhew that thou art not onely a ſinfull man, but impudent in ſinning. For though an evill heart is <hi>worſe then an evill tongue,</hi> and an ill thought then an evill word; yet when ill words ſpring from ill thoughts, and are as branches growing from the root of an evill heart, this ſhewes a man hightened in ſin; <hi>Sin hath got the maſtery of the heart wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n it freely vents it ſelfe at the tongue.</hi> Some keep their ſins downe by hypocriſie, and ſome by common modeſty; they are either ſo cunning that they will not, or ſo baſhfull that they dare not ſpeak out the filth that lyes within. But they are beyond, not onely modeſty, but hypocriſie, whoſe tongues can ſpeak all the evill that is in their heart; though the ſin of the heart
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48478:32"/> be worſe then the ſinne of the tongue, yet when tongue ſinnes are ſteept in the puddle of a corrupt heart, they are moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory: <hi>David</hi> ſinned when he ſayd, <hi>in his haſt, all men are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars:</hi> How greatly then doe they ſinne who tell lyes at their leiſure, and ſpeak evill with deliberation. That which is ſaid in haſt, is ſayd by the tongue alone, without the privity of the heart, but the heart is alwayes privy to that which is ſayd at leiſure. The Prophet taxeth thoſe, <hi>the ſhew of whoſe countenance did teſtifie againſt them (Iſ.</hi> 3.9.) They fall juſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as ſevere a cenſure, the ſound of whoſe tongues doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt them, for they alſo (as it followes in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>declare their ſin as Sodom, they hid it not.</hi> Further, this alſo argues the evill of evill ſpeaking, becauſe it wrongs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and infects the Auditors: The vanity or errour of the minde ſpoken out, is contagious; better keep it in, then ſpeak it out, but both are naught: 'tis onely good, when we purge it out. Though it be ſome allay and leſſening, yet it is no excuſe for ſinne, that we keep it in; God hates it, let it lye as cloſe as it will; and though a ſin kept cloſe, doth not hurt others; yet it is not onely hurtfull, but deadly to its keeper. They onely are out of danger, who as they doe not let evill goe out of the door of their mouths, ſo not lodge in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their heart.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have opened the charge contained in this part of the Chapter; in all which, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> hath reproved the ſpeech of <hi>Job,</hi> as vaine, empty, proud, paſſionate, and erroneous. He now proceeds to ſhew him (as he ſuppoſed) the errour of his opinion, and to confute it.</p>

Here is a ſtrong proofe of originall ſin, we are cleane but not of our ſelves; we are cleane under a fourfold notion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Cleane meritoriouſly by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Cleane efficaciouſly by the ſpirit uniting us to Chriſt, and ſanctifying our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Cleane inſtrumentally by the Word, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Chriſt the fountaine to us, and ſo purifies us (<hi>John</hi> 15.4.) <hi>You are cleane through the word which I have ſpoken unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We are cleane impulſively and attractively by faith (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.8.) <hi>He made no difference purifying their hearts by Faith;</hi> thus many are cleane, and but thus there is no man cleane; <hi>What is man that he ſhould be cleane?</hi>

                  <q>And he that is borne of a woman that he ſhould be righteous?</q>

                     <hi>Cleane and righteous</hi> are neer of one ſignification, yet in this place we may diſtinguiſh them; <hi>To be cleane,</hi> refers to the purity of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to be righteous, or to be juſtified (for ſo the word may be tranſlated) refers to the integrity of his life; from both it followes, Man cannot merit, for he is not <hi>cleane:</hi> he cannot anſwer God, for he is not <hi>righteous.</hi> As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſayd, <hi>What is man that hee ſhould either have any cleanneſſe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or that he ſhould be reputed and looked upon as righteous by others. (Both which he intends as applycable to Job.) If God ſhould ſearch thy nature, what art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be cleane? If God ſhould ſearch thy life, what art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous?</hi> The point of mans utter inability, to ſtand before God in himſelfe for juſtification, hath been met with, more then once before, and therefore I will not ſtay upon that neither, onely conſider the forme of expreſſion, or the periphraſis of Man.</p>

                     </note> becauſe among all creatures they are (in one ſenſe) the moſt holy, as having ever been without the leaſt ſpot or taint of ſin, whether in their natures, or in their lives; and having ever continued as the <hi>Houſhold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God,</hi> obſervant of, and obedient to all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>But we may rather take it in generall, both for the <hi>holyeſt of men,</hi> and for the <hi>holy Angels:</hi> Behold <hi>he puts no truſt in his Saints;</hi> no, not in thoſe who are moſt holy.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no created holineſſe ſure, ſtable, and perfect in it ſelfe:</hi> The glorious Angels which are, and ever ſhall be Saints in Heaven, and the Saints in Heaven who are like Angels, ſtand not in that holy and happy eſtate, by their owne ſufficiency, but by the decree and grace of God. Thoſe Angells which fell at firſt were holy, and they who now ſtand, might have fallen notwithſtanding their created holineſſe, if God had not ſuperadded confirming grace, which eſtabliſheth them for ever. Yet this is not all, that the Angels are imperfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might fall if not ſupported, there is ſomewhat more in it; for though the Angels are perfectly righteous in reference to the Law, (for the whole bent of their hearts is to God, and they love God with all their hearts, which is the fulfilling of the Law:) So that the obedience of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, is made the copy and patterne of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here on earth, as Chriſt hath taught us to pray, though (I ſay) the Angels are thus perfectly righteous in reference to the Law) yet there is a higher righteouſneſſe and holineſſe in God. <hi>There's but the holineſſe of obeying a Law, God hath the holineſſe of being a Law:</hi> They have a holineſſe without ſpot, yet it is but a finite, a created holineſſe; now what compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is there betweene finite, and infinite, created, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created; therefore though there be no blemiſh in the obedience
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48478:35"/> of Angels, none in their nature, none in their lives, yet God puts no truſt in them, he cannot lay the weight of his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon them, becauſe they are creatures.</p>
                  <p>The next clauſe doubles this point.</p>
                  <q>And the Heavens are not cleane in his ſight.</q>
                  <p>There is a difference among Interpreters what theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are; The Chaldee Paraphraſt, and ſome of the Ancients, underſtand the Angels, as in the former part of the Verſe, and they ſay the Angels are called the Heavens under a twofold conſideration:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe Angels are like the Heavens, in their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality and incorruptibility, in their order and ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among themſelves, as alſo in their power over ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or earthly bodies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By a Synechdoche, becauſe the Angels have their habitation in Heaven, thats their dwelling place; ſo Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates, <hi>Nor they of Heaven be cleane in his eyes;</hi> that is, the Inhabitants of Heaven are not cleane in his eyes.<note place="margin">Caeruleus Tibris caelo gratiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus amnis. <hi>i. e.</hi> diis vel caelico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. <hi>Virg. l. 8.</hi>

                     <hi>The Heathen Poet calls thoſe whom he ſuppoſed dwellers in Heaven by the Name of Heaven;</hi> deſcribing a pleaſant River, he calls it, <hi>A River pleaſant to Heaven;</hi> that is, to thoſe who are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Others by <hi>Heaven</hi> underſtand the Saints in Heaven, not the Angels; and that alſo upon a twofold reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe God is ſaid to dwell in the Saints,<note place="margin">Sancti in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus tanquam in caelis habitare dicitur Deus, caeli dicuntur, quae allegoria frequentiſſima eſt inter anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quos patres, <hi>Pined.</hi>
                     </note> they are his habitation, and whereſoever God dwels he makes a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe the Saints, not onely thoſe in Heaven, but they on earth, <hi>have their converſation in Heaven; (Phil.</hi> 3.20.) As carnall and earthly minded men are called <hi>Earth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their hearts and converſations are fixed to the earth; ſo ſpirituall and heavenly minded men may be called <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe their hearts and converſations are fixed in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may rather underſtand it in a proper ſenſe; <hi>the heavens,</hi> that is, <hi>The heavenly bodies are not cleare in thy ſight;</hi> the heavens are the moſt excellent and pureſt part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And therefore this interpretation, or rather plaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the words, ſuites the ſcope of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> fully, who as he ſpake before of the Angels, who are the pureſt of all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall

                     </note> yet theſe are not pure in the ſight of God, therefore no man is. The heavens have a kinde of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe in them: the <hi>Moone</hi> hath her ſpots, yea the Moone is but a ſpot, if Philoſophers may be credited, who tell us that all the Stars (in their ſenſe the Moone is a Star) are but as the ſpots of Heaven. <hi>A Starre</hi> (as they define) <hi>being the thicker and groſſer part of its Orbe:</hi> The heavens themſelves are ſo fine and liquid, ſo thin, and fluid, that they cannot hold the light; therefore the Lord made thoſe Celeſtiall bodies the Sunne, Moone, and Stars, more compact and groſſe, that ſo they might both receive, and retaine the light, as alſo tranſmit and give it out to the World here below. Theſe are ſpots in the Heavens; and though they appeare as the glory or <hi>Beauty-ſpots</hi> of Heaven to our ſight, and are ſo indeed; yet <hi>theſe are not cleane in the ſight of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, the heavens are furtheſt removed from all earthly dregs and droſſe,<note place="margin">

                     </note> ſo that they are cleane, not onely in regard of their nature and conſtitution, but alſo in regard of their ſite and poſition; being placed ſo far from the ſinck of the World, the earth, they never received any ſtaine or defilement from it; yet theſe heavens are not cleane in his ſight. God doth not make that which is cleane, not cleane by his ſeeing it; but his ſight is infinitely above all the cleanneſſe which he ſees. That may be cleane, conſidered ſimply or in it ſelfe, which before God, or to the eye of God, is as an uncleane thing.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God is ſo clear-ſighted, that the cleaneſt creatures are uncleane in his ſight;</hi> the very cleanneſſe of the creature, is uncleanneſſe before him, much more, compared to him. For if one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be ſo cleane that another creature which is cleane may be ſayd to have no cleanneſſe in compariſon of it: Then ſurely God is ſo cleane, that the cleaneſt creatures have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no cleanneſſe in compariſon of his. The Stars are very beautifull bodies, and full of light, yet the Sunne hath ſo much light, that it darkens all the Stars, and cauſeth them to diſappeare, when it appeareth: Now, if the Stars have no light in the ſight of the Sunne, what light hath the Sunne in the ſight of God? he that puts all the perfections that the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48478:36"/> creature hath into the creature, hath infinitely more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in himſelfe: Thoſe excellencies which are divided and ſcattered all the Creation over, are not onely contracted and united in God, but unconceiveably exceeded by him.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48478:37"/> that which the eare cannot indure to heare of, that which is a ſtink in the noſtrils, and which the hand will not touch: Such an abominable thing the word beares, and ſuch is man; God loathes him, and is of purer eyes then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity, much more a lumpe of iniquity; he is as a ſtink in the noſtrills of God, nor will he touch him (for any thing in him) unleſſe with a hand of juſtice to deſtroy him.</p>

                     <hi>Sinfull man is loathſome, and abominable unto God. How much more abominable is man;</hi> This is not to be underſtood of ſome particular man, or of ſome ſort of men who are more vile then others, but take the beſt of men, the moſt accompliſht and compleate in the whole courſe of nature, theſe are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; they are deprived of the Image of God, they are ſtampt with the Image of Satan, they are not onely unable to doe that which is good, but they are totally averſe from it, yea, enemies to it; is not all this enough to render man abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in the ſight of God? And ſo abominable is man, that he doth not onely diſpleaſe the eye of God, but the very eyes of thoſe who have received the grace of God. A godly man turnes away from the wicked, as the wicked man doth from the godly. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 29.27.) <hi>An unjuſt man is an abomination to the juſt; and he that is upright in his way is an abomination to the wicked.</hi> The diſtaſt is mutuall; 'tis called enmity (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.) here abomination. The wicked man ſaith (as the Devill to Chriſt) <hi>What have I to doe with thee thou Son of David.</hi> The godly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48478:37"/> man ſaith, <hi>What have I to doe with thee thou ſon of Belial.</hi> 'Tis the ſin of the wicked man to abhor the righteous, for he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors him for his righteouſneſſe: 'Tis the duty of a godly man to abhor the wicked, and he abhors him onely for his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. To doe ſo is a peice of his character, <hi>Who ſhall dwell in the Mountaine of God:</hi> He is a man, <hi>in whoſe eye a vile</hi> (that is, a wicked) <hi>perſon is abhorred, Pſal.</hi> 15.4. Much leſſe can he looke pleaſedly, or pleaſantly upon a wicked man; his heart riſeth againſt him, not out of pride, or high thoughts of himſelfe, or from the lowneſſe of his condition, if he be poor; but from the odiouſneſſe of his diſpoſition, and his oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goodneſſe: Such a man is vile in his eſteeme, how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſo ever he is in the eye of the World.</p>
                  <p>Againe (which ſhewes yet further, that a man in nature is abominable) when any man repents and turnes to the Lord, he is an abomination to himſelfe; he is abominable to God, and good men, before he repents; and upon the ſame account, he is abominable to himſelfe when he repents. For as God and good men before, ſo he then ſees his owne vileneſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, then he ſmells the filthineſſe of his owne corrupt heart: This the Prophet aſſures us (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31.) where the Lord promiſeth to powre out the ſpirit of repentance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people, <hi>To take away the heart of ſtone, and give them a heart of fleſh:</hi> and then <hi>They ſhall loath themſelves for all their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations,</hi> as not being able to endure the ſtench of their owne corruptions: When <hi>Job</hi> at the ſight of God, ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more clearly, then he cryes out, <hi>Wherefore I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent in duſt and aſhes:</hi> If a good man ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, is an abomination to himſelfe, how much more is ſinfull man abominable in the ſight of God?</p>
                  <p>And (which aggravates the point to the higheſt) Not onely is a man repenting abominable to himſelfe, but even a wicked man upon a cleare diſcovery of himſelfe to himſelfe becomes an abomination to himſelfe, though he be farre from repentance. Thats the reaſon why a wicked man cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to ſearch his owne heart, or returne into his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8.) <hi>Remember this, ſhew your ſelves men, bring it againe to minde;</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>Bring it to your hearts: They who love their ſin, love not to looke to their ſinfull hearts:</hi> they dare not turne their eye inward or upward, not upward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48478:38"/> there is ſo much holineſſe in God; not inward becauſe there is ſo much filthineſſe in themſelves. Hence the Lord threatens (<hi>Na.</hi> 3.5, 6.) becauſe they would not looke on their owne filthineſſe, that he would ſhew their filthineſſe to all the World, <hi>He would ſhew the Nations their nakedneſſe, and the Kingdomes their ſhame:</hi> And howſoever a naturall man hides his abomination from his eye now, or will not ſee it, yet all ſhall be layd open to him in the day of judgement, which will be as a day of <hi>the revelation of the righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God:</hi> So a day of the revelation of the unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man: And then he ſhall (though too late) abhor himſelfe for ever. There hath been a diſpute whether the ſins of Beleevers ſhall be opened at that day, but there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but the ſins of Unbeleevers ſhall, and that not onely to ſhame them, but to puniſh and torment them; yea poſſibly, the ſight of ſin will be a greater torment to them then all their other torments, and to be led about (as the Prophet was in reference to others) from one uncleane roome of their hearts to another, there to behold all the abominations of their hearts, will be the very pit of Hell, <hi>O how abominable,</hi> and as it followes in the Text.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48478:38"/> together (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>Abominable, diſobedient, and unto every good worke reprobate;</hi> that is, unfit for every good worke: We may ſay of man (in this ſenſe) as the Prophet (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 15.3.) doth of the Vine, <hi>Sonne of man, what is the Vine tree more then another tree?</hi> excellent to yeeld Wine; but in the third Verſe we have another anſwer, <hi>Shall wood be taken thereof to doe any worke, or will men make a pin of it to hange any Veſſell thereon;</hi> will you build a houſe of <hi>Vine Timber,</hi> or will you ſo much as make <hi>a Pin of it?</hi> The Vine is not fit to make a Pin of; thus we may ſay of a carnall man, he is unprofitable,<note place="margin">Qui ſibi ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam eſt cui uſui bonus eſt?</note> will the Lord uſe him in any worke? no, he is reprobate to every good worke; will he ſerve the Lords turne, ſo much as to make a <hi>Pin of?</hi> That is, is he profitable for the leaſt ſervice? No, he is not. He is alſo like the Corne growing upon the houſe top, whereof <hi>The Reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that binds up the Sheaves his boſome.</hi> The reaſon why man appeares thus filthy, is, becauſe he deales ſo much with filth; and he is thus unfit to doe any good, becauſe he is continually doing evill, as it followes in the laſt clauſe of this Verſe.</p>
                  <q>Which drinketh iniquity like water.</q>
                  <p>Will you know what declares man abominable and filthy in the ſight of God? It is not his poverty, his ſickneſſe, his raggs, or any externall defilement, nothing but ſinne makes him ſo: <hi>He drinkes in iniquity like water;</hi> this makes him as filthy as the dirt and mire he treads upon, or as the vomit and dunge which he caſteth out.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note in generall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sin, and ſin onely makes man abominable, and filthy in the ſight of God;</hi> nothing can defile the ſoule but ſin; though a man be cloathed with filthy garments, though his skin be over-run with filthy ſores; though he lye in a ſtinking Channel, yet the Lord will not ſay, he is abominable or filthy, in theſe reſpects: for even in ſuch a ſtate, or at ſuch a time, Chriſt may have taken him in his armes and kiſſed him with the kiſſes of his lips. But though he goe cloathed in Scarlet, though he lye in a bed of Ivory, and is perfumed with all the ſpices of <hi>Arabia,</hi> yet ſin makes him filthy and abominable in the eye of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>The multiplyed acts of ſin are an evidence that man is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48478:39"/> ſinfull, or that he is abominable and filthy. <hi>He that doth righteouſneſſe is righteous,</hi> and he that doth unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is unrighteous. If man were not filthy, he could not drinke iniquity; that is, feed upon, and delight in ſin, which is but filthineſſe.</p>
                  <p>This expreſſion of mans ſinfulneſſe is further conſiderable, he doth not onely commit iniquity, <hi>but hee drinkes iniquity,</hi> and he doth not ſip at it, but <hi>hee drinkes it like water. Elihu</hi> ſpeaks thus (<hi>Job</hi> 34.7.) <hi>What man is like Job who drinketh up ſcorning like water;</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 26.6.) <hi>Hee that ſends a meſſage by the hand of a foole, cutteth off the feet, and drinketh dammage;</hi> that is, he ſhall have dammage enough, a full draught of it, his belly-full of it, by ſending ſuch an empty-headed meſſenger upon his errand. So <hi>to drinke iniquity,</hi> and to <hi>drinke it like water,</hi> is to doe aboundance of iniquity. I ſhall give ſeven obſervations, which will diſcover the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of this manner of ſpeaking, and draw out the meaning of <hi>He drinks iniquity like water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, thus, <hi>Men naturally hath a ſtrong appetite or deſire to ſin,</hi> Mans naturall deſire is to nothing elſe but ſin. Drinking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes appetite; a man doth not drink (ordinarily) till he is thirſty: And though Drunkards have ſometimes no thirſt, yet they have alwayes a ſtrong deſire to drink. Sinfull man is a thirſt for, and deſires the drafts of ſin (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19.) <hi>He commits iniquity with greedineſſe,</hi> which is a Metaphor taken from eating and drinking: And becauſe man hath not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſire after any thing then to drinke, therefore it is gone to a Proverbe among us, when we would ſhew our willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to doe a thing, we ſay, <hi>We will doe it as willingly as to drink when we are a thirſt.</hi> Such is the bent of man to ſin, that he hath no more reluctance to commit it, then the thirſty man hath to drink: He thirſteth after it as vehemently, as <hi>David</hi> did after God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.2.) <hi>My ſoule thirſteth for God, for the living God; as the Hartpanteth after the water brookes, ſo panteth my ſoule after thee O God.</hi> Or againe, the heart of man thirſteth after the waters of iniquity, as <hi>David</hi> thirſted after the waters of the well of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> who will give me to drink of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Well of <hi>Bethlem.</hi> At which word, ſome of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men brake through the whole Hoſt of the Enemy, to fetch that water. When man thirſts for this water of iniquity, his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48478:39"/> owne heart or hand will breake through all oppoſitions, through Lawe, through conſcience, through counſell, through an hoſt of threatnings armed againſt him, through judgements inflicted on him, he will breake through all theſe, that he may have a draught of his beloved <hi>iniquity-water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, To drinke, notes a ſtrong deſire, ſo pleaſure and content; and where there is a great deale of deſire, there is alſo much content, and pleaſure in drinking.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is a very pleaſant thing to a carnall man to ſin, he drinkes iniquity, not onely like water, but in this ſenſe, like the ſweeteſt Wine; a draught of ſin is the onely Merry-goe-downe to a carnall man.</hi> A drunkard likes his drinke well, but he likes his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe better: His liquor is ſweet to him, but O how ſweet is the ſatisfying of his luſt! When he hath his deſire he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when he is fruſtrated of his deſire he is ſullen, and like <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he could not obtaine <hi>Naboaths</hi> Vineyard, he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, and refuſes (as he did) to eate bread, becauſe he cannot have this water of iniquity to drink.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider the eaſineſſe of it, to drink is no hard labour; hence we ſpeake proverbially, <hi>I can do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſuch a thing as eaſily as I can drinke;</hi> there are no bones in drink: <hi>Good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi> (we ſay alſo) <hi>needs no chewing:</hi> Beſides, it is eaſie to drink, becauſe it is naturall to drink; Children have no Tutors to teach them to drink: Againe, to drink water is eaſie, becauſe we may get it eaſily; water is not kept under Lock and Key, but in the common Storehouſes or Cellars of nature.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A naturall man ſins with eaſe;</hi> it is no paine to him to ſin: Sin is not eaſie in the effects, ſo it leaves us in <hi>Little-eaſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>q.d.</hi> Facillimè laxatis conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae habenis in omnia omnis generis ſcelera ſe dat praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. <hi>Bold.</hi>
                     </note> paine and ſorrow enough are the fruits of it; but it is eaſie in the act of it; it is to a wicked heart, as eaſie as to drinke water which is every way eaſie.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, Sin is a common thing, every where to be had; ſin may be found (like water) in every Ditch; ſin alſo is like thoſe waters which flow naturally, you need not pumpe for it, or fetch it up with Buckets.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, No man needs be taught to ſin, children learne that leſſon (and till the ſpirit of God teach them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not unlearne it) without a Schoole-maſter.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:48478:40"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Moſt ſins in the act of them, have little labour or difficulty in them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.20.<note place="margin">Quaſi per in curiam &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, quaſi ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil agens.</note>) <hi>Thou ſatteſt and ſpakeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy Mothers Son.</hi> A man may both ſpeake and doe evill, while he ſits ſtill, and doth nothing; an idle poſture may ſerve the turne for ſuch work as that.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Water is but ſmall drinke, water hath little pleaſure in it and leſſe ſtrength in it. And therefore when Chriſt would ſhew that the loweſt courteſie or charity done to one of his, ſhall be highly eſteemed by him, he ſaith, <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall give to drinke unto one of theſe little ones, a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely, in the name of a Diſciple, he ſhall not looſe his reward, Matth.</hi> 10.42.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man will ſin upon very eaſie tearmes, and ſmalleſt conſiderations.</hi> Though there be little got by it, though he get but a draught of water by it; though his ſin bring him in ſcare any thing of advantage, yet ſin he will; the act of ſinning pleaſeth ſome, more then the conſequence or gaine of ſin. <hi>They care not much whether it be water or Wine which they drinke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eo improbita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis evadit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius, ut vel ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo peccati &amp; impietatis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, nulla prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea mercede propoſita, pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inſerviat.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo it be iniquity which they drinke.</hi> As the Saints, in a height of holineſſe, will doe good, though they doe themſelves little good, or get no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantage by it: They reſolve to do good for good ſake; the duty abſtractly conſidered, or the act it ſelfe, is the thing that pleaſeth them; ſo to a naturall man, the very commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſin ſatisfieth him more then the outward Income or Revenue of his ſin: <hi>He doth evill for evill ſake, and ſerves his luſt for love, not for wages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Drinking is a frequent act; a temperate man drinkes every day, and often every day; healthy men eate often, and moſt men drink oftner then they eate: So that to drinke iniquity hints alſo the frequency of committing iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A carnall heart ſins often:</hi> He ſins, and ſins, hee cannot but ſin,<note place="margin">Inveteratum ac inſeparabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem peccandi habitum &amp; conſuetudinem denotat.</note> it is a continuall, yea a continued act; he hath never done, he is like the Drunkard that muſt alwayes be tipling. Or like the covetous man, who is alwaies <hi>having,</hi> and the more he hath the more he deſires to have: Covetouſneſſe is a dry drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and drunkenneſſe is a wet covetouſneſſe: both returne often upon the ſame acts; and ſo doth every ſinner naturally. <hi>He cannot ceaſe from ſin,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Every ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48478:40"/> of the thoughts of his heart is onely evill, and that continually.</hi> The cup of iniquity is never from his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>To drink iniquity like water</hi> notes not onely the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſinning, but the abundance of ſinning; they take great draughts of ſin, who drinke iniquity like water: Such as are accuſtomed to drink water (in many places it is the common drink) ſuch, I ſay, drink more then men uſually doe of Wine, or ſtrong drinke; firſt, becauſe Wine and artificiall liquors are coſtly; but you may drinke water good cheape, and none will grutch you. Secondly, Water is not ſtrong nor vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, it doth not burden the braine like your heady liquors. Now though iniquity be ſomewhat unlike water in both theſe reſpects (for to ſome their ſins are coſtly enough at preſent, and they will coſt all very deare (except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them before) at the day of reckoning; ſin alſo flyes up into the braine, and doth as much beſot, as defile the ſoule. Now, I ſay, though ſin be thus unlike water) yet the naturall man drinkes it like water, he takes in and ſends out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of it; what cares he what it coſts him, or how it beſots him, neither the preſent diſtemperings of it, nor the after reckonings for it, trouble him.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Eating and drinking are the ſupport of nature, by theſe the body is maintained in life; now as the body of nature is maintained by eating and drinking,<note place="margin">Perbibiſti ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatem &amp; ita viſceribus immiſcuiſti, ut niſi cum ipſis exire non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. <hi>Sen. lib. P.</hi> de ira.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo the body and life of ſin, the corrupt ſtate and ſtrength of man are maintained by the continuall actings of ſin:</hi> The old <hi>Adam</hi> is nouriſhed by theſe waters of iniquity. We ſay in nature, wee are nouriſhed by that out of which we are made, that which is the matter of our conſtitution is the matter of our nutrition; ſo in this caſe, a man in nature is compoſed or conſtituted of ſin, and a naturall man is nouriſhed, and preſerved by ſinning.<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t deficienti humido reſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendo, nihil aptius eſt aqua, &amp; utilius; ia hominis beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudini, quae ipſi de eſt, conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandae, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra nihil ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit niſi pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. <hi>Coc.</hi>
                     </note> Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall acts increaſe the habit; and as a godly man is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by holy acts, and ſtrengthened in ſpirit by ſpirituall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedence; doing the will of God is the food of the ſoule. As Chriſt ſpeakes (<hi>John</hi> 4.21.) ſo doth every true Chriſtian in his degree, <hi>It is my meat and drinke to doe the will of my Father which is in Heaven;</hi> or as <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth of himſelfe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 23.12.) <hi>I eſteeme the words of thy mouth more then my neceſſary food:</hi> Thus alſo the old man ſaith, It is my meat and drink to doe the will of the fleſh, and that is indeed the will of his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48478:41"/> Father which is in Hell. The words of his mouth, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Lawes I eſteem more then my neceſſary food.</p>
                  <p>So much for the opening and illuſtration of this Scripture-phraſe, <hi>Drinking iniquity like water:</hi> I ſhall propound one Quere in generall, concerning the whole Verſe, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it. Here is a full deſcription of ſinfull man: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeakes this ſtrictly of a perſon unregenerate, and ſo applyeth it to <hi>Job,</hi> or whether this deſcription be not alſo applicable to a man who is regenerate and godly for the maine, and was ſo intended by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> is here a queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Some conceive that the words will ſuite none but an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, and tis granted upon all hands, that they are moſt ſutable to him. An unregenerate man, is <hi>abominable and filthy, he drinks iniquity like water;</hi> And yet in a qualified ſenſe, we may ſay all this of a man regenerate: Even <hi>He,</hi> in reference to the remaines of corruption, is <hi>abominable and filthy,</hi> and <hi>He,</hi> under ſome diſtempers and temptations, <hi>drinks iniquity like water:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Agit Eliphaz cum Jobo non ut improbo, ſed ut errante. <hi>Coc.</hi>
                     </note> which words of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> a moderne Interpreter para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels with thoſe of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning himſelfe (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25.) <hi>With the fleſh I ſerve the Law of ſin.</hi> And delivers his opinion in this caſe, That though <hi>Eliphaz</hi> aimed at <hi>Job</hi> in all this, yet he deales with him not as with a wicked man, but as with an erring brother. For whereas he had ſayd (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.23.) <hi>How many are mine iniquities? Eliphaz</hi> might judge by his words, that ſurely he thought his iniquities were not very many: and whereas he had ſayd at the 26. <hi>Verſe</hi> of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Thou makeſt me to poſſeſſe the iniquityes of my youth; Eliphaz</hi> might collect, ſurely this man thinks his elder yeares have been ſo free from ſin, that God can finde nothing in them, which might juſtifie him in theſe ſevere puniſhments. Now <hi>Eliphaz</hi> oppoſeth theſe apprehenſions, and would both teach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, that as originall ſin pollutes every man wholly, till he is waſhed and borne againe by the ſpirit; ſo no man is ſo farre waſhed by the ſpirit, but that many ſpots and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the fleſh, doe ſtill cleave to him, and often appeare upon him. And <hi>Eliphaz</hi> may be conceived to handle <hi>Job</hi> in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſhew him, that though a man be in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, yet he can deſerve nothing at the hand of God, becauſe his holineſſe is ſtill imperfect, and his corruptions are abominable.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48478:41"/>
                  <p>Secondly, That the greateſt ſufferings and afflictions of good men in this life, are very conſiſtent with the Juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That he might humble <hi>Job,</hi> who (as he feared) was ſtill too high in his owne opinion, and thought better of himſelfe then did become him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To provoke him to reſiſt his owne corruptions ſtedfaſtly.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, To beare the croſſe (which the Lord had layd upon him for his good, eſpecially for the taming and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of his corruptions) patiently.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> doeh not diſpute with him upon this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, or ſuppoſition, or not upon this onely, <hi>That man by nature, and without the grace of God, is filthy and abominable, drinking iniquity like water;</hi> but upon this, or this in conſort with the former, <hi>That man in a ſtate of grace, or a godly man is filthy and abominable, in reference to the fleſh that dwelleth in him; and that in reference to his frequent ſinnings, he may be ſayd to drink iniquity like water:</hi> And therefore <hi>Job</hi> had no reaſon to be proud, how good ſo ever he was, or how much good ſoever he had done; and that there was all the reaſon in the World he ſhould be patient, and take it well at the hand of God, how much evill ſo ever he ſhould ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>This reſolution of the Quere, as it is profitable, ſo proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For howſoever <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds had branded him in diverſe paſſages of this diſpute, as a wicked man and an hypocrite, and were ſo underſtood by <hi>Job,</hi> as appeares in his anſwers and replyes; yet 'tis moſt likely his Freinds ſpake ſo in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his actions, not in reference to his ſtate. That he had done like an Hypocrite, or a wicked man, was clearely their opinion; but there is no neceſſity to conclude from what they ſayd, that they judged him abſolutely to be one.</p>

                  <hi>ELiphaz</hi> having argued againſt <hi>Jobs</hi> ſuppoſed opinion, of <hi>Selfe-cleanneſſe, and perſonall righteouſneſſe,</hi> proceeds to the confirmation of his owne poſition, to which he leads us, by a new Exordium, or Preface, in the 17, 18, and 19.

                  <hi>Therefore this is a truth.</hi> The major propoſition is the ſum of the Preface contained in the 17, 18. and 19. Verſes; The minor, or ſecond Propoſition, is held forth in the 20. Verſe, and is proſecuted to the one and thirtieth.</p>

                  <p>But what will <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſhew him? Not that which he had phanſied, but that which he was aſſured of.</p>
                  <q>That which I have ſeene I will declare:</q>
                  <p>Seeing is a ſure and particular ſenſe; yet as the act of one ſenſe, is often put for the act of another; ſo <hi>Seeing,</hi> which is the moſt noble of the ſenſes, is often put for all. <hi>That which I have ſeene;</hi> is, that which I have learned, that which I have fetched in, or collected by the helpe of all my ſenſes; yea, by my reaſon and underſtanding, <hi>That doe I here declare unto thee.</hi> More ſtrictly, <hi>Seeing</hi> may be taken two wayes: Firſt, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting experience; I have not onely heard ſome reports about theſe things, but I have ſeen, and obſerved them my ſelfe; there is a ſtronger conviction in this, becauſe the ſenſe of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is leſſe fallible then that of hearing; and we ſay, <hi>One eye witneſſe, is better then ten eare witneſſes:</hi> Secondly, <hi>as I have ſeene,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Certius eſt, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, quam audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi, oculatus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis potior eſt aurito. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                     </note> may be taken for common experiences among men: ſo for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall revelation from God. Some Divine revelations were made in viſions; and all Divine Revelations were ſo cleare and evident, that they were or might be called Viſions, as if the matter of them had been repreſented to the eye; and hence ſuch as God honoured and truſted with thoſe Revelations were called <hi>Seers</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.9.) <hi>He that is now called a Prophet was before time called a Seer:</hi> And hee was called a Seer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cleareneſſe of thoſe meſſages and manifeſtations was ſo great, that they might be judged as objects of the eye, rather then of the eare, or of the underſtanding. Thus the whole Book of the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is called, <hi>A Viſion, or a thing ſeene; The Viſion of Iſaiah the Prophet, which he ſaw concerning Judah and Jeruſalem, (Chap.</hi> 1.1.) Yet the Prophet did not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48478:43"/> receive all the Doctrines which he Preached, and Propheſies which he publiſhed in that Book, by viſion: but the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation from God, was ſo full of light to his underſtanding, that it was as if he had ſeene it with his eye. Some expound ſo here, <hi>That which I have ſeene;</hi> that is, that which I have had a ſpeciall revelation about. As if hee referr'd to the fourth Chapter, where <hi>Eliphaz</hi> reports to <hi>Job</hi> what a dreadfull Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had, and what the matter of it was, even much like that which is repreſented in the following part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A learned Interpreter agrees, that it was a Viſion; but, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Mihi non vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur improbabile aut deluſum fuiſſe a diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, vel ipſum ſomnium ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod aut inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum eſſe, ut ſibi conciliaret authoritatem. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                     </note> it was either a fained, artificiall Viſion (ſuch are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Popery) or it was a deluſion of the Devill. I doe not at all admit, this latter branch of his opinion; but I muſt reject the former, as altogether unworthy of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> who was ſurely a man of integrity, and fearing God, and was therefore above ſuch affected falſhoods, and ſtudied deceits, to gaine reſpect and credit among men.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore inſiſt upon the former ſenſe, <hi>That which I have ſeene;</hi> that is, by common experience, <hi>that will I declare unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>What we declare, or communicate to others, wee ſhould be well aſſured of our ſelves;</hi> That which I have ſeene, declare I unto thee: while we declare, either by way of inſtruction, to teach true Doctrine, or by way of information, to report the truth of action, 'tis our duty to declare upon knowledge. So the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeene with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life, that which we have ſeene and heard, declare wee unto you:</hi> He brings in the operations of three ſenſes, Seeing, Hearing, and Feeling, as witneſſes to avouch for, and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that which he had declared; we muſt take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring upon ſurmiſes, and probabilities, upon a bare <hi>Heare-ſay,</hi> or <hi>I thought ſo:</hi> That which we have clearely learned, we may teach confidently, and nothing beſides that.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As we muſt have a ground for what we declare to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo when we have a good ground we muſt declare;</hi> That which we know, we ſhould make knowne; <hi>That which I have ſeene I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48478:43"/> declare unto you;</hi> holy knowledge muſt be communicated, ſuch light muſt not be put under a buſhell, nor muſt ſuch a Talent be wrapt up in a Napkin: <hi>He that is taught ſhould teach. When thou art converted</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter) ſtrengthen thy Brethren:</hi> Let others partake of thy experiences. <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and I will tell you what God hath done for my ſoule: Philip (John</hi> 1.43.) being found by Chriſt, finds <hi>Nathaneel,</hi> and ſaith unto him, <hi>We have found him of whom Moſes, and the Prophets did write, Jeſus of Nazareth, the Son of Joſeph:</hi> He quickly declared what he had ſeen, and ſo ſhould we. This is the firſt proofe, <hi>That which I have ſeene, I declare,</hi> experience is my ground.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond proofe, is from the conſent of others, from the authority of the Ancient.</p>

                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> treads the ſame ſteps, as in his firſt diſcourſe with <hi>Job.</hi> For after he had there delivered the contents or ſum of his Viſion, he appeales to the judgement of the Saints, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.

                  <q>Wiſe men:</q>
                  <p>He doth not meane worldly wiſe men, Philoſophers and Polititians; but godly wiſe men, theſe haue told it from their Fathers; their Fathers told it them, and they told it me; ſo that this poſition claimes by two deſcents at leaſt. One of the Rabbins gives it three, if not more: for by the Fathers
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48478:44"/> of the wiſe men he underſtands, not their immediate Fathers onely, but thoſe who were more remote and further off; yea, poſſibly thoſe who were furtheſt off, even as far as <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is an ingenuity to acknowledge by whom we profit,</hi> wiſe men have told me this, I received it from others, as well as collected it by my owne experience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Note:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth ſhould be conveyed downe to our Poſterity:</hi> Truth is a more precious inheritance then Land or Money; if Parents are carefull to ſecure (as much as they can) earthly things to their Children, how much more ſhould they be carefull to ſecure heavenly? In the firſt Ages of the World, till the Law was given on Mount Sinai, faithfull men were in ſtead of Books, and Tradition ſupplyed the want of Scripture: But now, our recourſe muſt be to what God hath commanded to be written, not to what men have ſaid. No Tradition is of any force, but as conſentient with Scripture, and none of ſo much force as Scripture. The <hi>Councill of Trent,</hi> in the fifth Seſſion, thunders out <hi>Anathemaes</hi> againſt thoſe who receive not Tradition with the ſame godly affection, and devotion, with which they receive the Scripture it ſelfe; <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about Tradition, entitles his Book thus, <hi>Of the Word of God not written;</hi> as if the Word of God were to be divided into theſe two orders, <hi>The Word written,</hi> and <hi>the Word not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi> Tradition with him is the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwritten word,</hi> and muſt be held of as much authority as the Word written; <hi>This is</hi> (as Chriſt taxeth the Phariſees) <hi>to make the word of God of none effect, through mans Tradition:</hi> It is ſtill a wiſe mans duty to to tell Poſterity what the Word and Truth of God is, but we muſt not receive any thing, as a truth of God, upon the bare Word of the wiſeſt men, <hi>Wiſe men have told their Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And have not hid it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a twofold hiding; firſt, a hiding to keep a thing ſafe, that we looſe it not; ſecondly, a hiding, that we keep it cloſe, and not communicate it: In the former ſenſe, we muſt hide the truth of God, but we may not in the latter. When <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have hid thy Commandements in my heart:</hi> when <hi>Mary hid the ſayings of Chriſt in her hart;</hi> and when the man that found the treaſure (<hi>Ma.</hi> 13.44.) <hi>Went away and hid
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48478:44"/> it, and for joy thereof ſould all he had, and bought the field:</hi> All theſe hid it, that it might be forth-comming for their owne uſe, they did not hide it, as unwilling to bring it forth, for the uſe of others; ſo the idle Servant hid his Talent, and was juſtly condemned for hiding it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth muſt not be hid from others:</hi> Truth is a common good, no man hath the ſole property of it; every one may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge his part of this poffeſſion; and the more we part with it to others, the more we increaſe our owne poſſeſſion. Truth multiplies in its degree to us, while we make diviſion of it to thouſands. A Candle gives not the leſs light to the owner, becauſe many ſtanders by, ſee by it, and this Candle gives a clearer light to us when we let many ſee by it: <hi>Our knowledge is perfected while it is communicated.</hi> This Candle therfore is not to be put under a buſhell, but muſt be ſet upon a Candleſtick, that all may ſee by the light of it. <hi>Shall I</hi> (ſaith the Lord, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.) <hi>hide from Abraham the thing that I am about to doe?</hi> No, I will not, For <hi>I know Abraham will not hide it: Hee will command his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> The Iſraelites were charged to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the wonders which God wrought for them, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which he appointed them, when they were delivered out of Aegypt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will open my mouth in a Parable</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>I will utter darke ſayings of old, which wee have heard and knowne: And our Fathers have told us, we will not hide them from their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhewing to the Generations to come, the praiſes of the Lord, and his ſtrength, and the wonderfull works which hee hath done (Pſal.</hi> 78.2, 3, 4.) 'Tis our duty to preſerve memorialls of the workes of God, and to declare his word to all that are about us. What wiſe men know from their Fathers, they will not hide.</p>
                  <p>

                     </note>Againe, the word <hi>Stranger</hi> is taken for one that is erroneous, or idolatrous; for a man unſound in Doctrine, or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in Worſhip: Wiſe men to whom alone the earth was given, had no ſuch ſtranger paſſing among them; they were not mixed with idolatrous and uncircumciſed Nations, they did not communicate with them in worſhip, as in after times the people of Iſrael did.</p>
                  <p>This notion of the ſtranger, is an advantage to <hi>Eliphaz;</hi> as if he had ſayd, The wiſe men whoſe authority I produce in this cauſe, were ſound in judgement, and pure in worſhip they did not mingle themſelves with Idolaters and Hereticks, they neither learned their workes, not received their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and are therefore witneſſes worthy of credit, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom there lyes no juſt exception. <hi>No ſtranger paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we take ſtranger in the firſt ſenſe for an enemy, then the word <hi>Paſſed</hi> ſignifies as much as invaded, and may well be tranſlated to a military motion: No ſtranger or enemy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that is, none matched among them, or through their

                  <p>But if we take <hi>Stranger</hi> in the ſecond ſenſe, for an Idolater, or a man of unſound Principles, then, <hi>No ſtranger paſſed among them,</hi> is, ſuch were not received, and embraced by them, nor admitted among them.</p>

(2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13, 14.) <hi>Be not unequally yoaked together with unbeleevers, for what fellowſhip hath righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe with unrighteouſneſſe, and what communion hath light with darkneſſe, and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial:</hi> &amp;c. Theſe can never agree together: Let no ſuch ſtranger <hi>paſſe,</hi> or be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved among us in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel; there is not onely ſin in letting ſuch paſſe with our approbation, but danger; and that a double danger. Both which are aſſigned as reaſons why wee ſhould come out of Babylon (<hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4.)</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we are in danger of partaking of their ſins, and that both by contracting the ſpot of their ſins, as alſo the guilt of their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are in danger of partaking of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as it there follows, <hi>That yee receive not her plagues.</hi> There is no ſafety in being neer thoſe, who are under the curſe of God: <hi>The companion of fooles ſhall be deſtroyed (Prov.</hi> 13 20.) though poſſibly he be not a foole in any other reſpect, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is in ſuch company.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Taking it for <hi>a ſtrange or wicked thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note:</p>
                  <p>That, <hi>It is the honour of Magiſtrates, when no evill paſſeth qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in their Territories:</hi> When neither Idolatry in the things of God, nor injuſtice, nor oppreſſion in the things of men, finde any favour with them, this is at once their duty, and their glory.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>His externall paine is of two ſorts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as God layes upon him, or caſts him into; for though many are the afflictions of the righteous, from the hand of God, yet the righteous have not all the afflictions, wicked men have ſome: They are not onely beaten with ſcourges, but ſmitten with ſcorpions; <hi>God raines downe upon them ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt; this is the portion of many of their cups, even in this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such as a wicked man brings upon himſelfe; Maſter <hi>Broughtons</hi> reading aymes at theſe paines. <hi>The wicked kills himſelfe all his dayes.</hi> A wicked man is often very active, ſometimes extreamly malitious againſt others, ſo malitious that he murders them; and yet it may truely be ſayd he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>kils himſelfe</hi> all his dayes. The ſelfe-love of a wicked man deſtroyes him, and his very earneſtneſſe to avoyd trouble, tumbles him into it: And this is cleare, if we conſider ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the way which a wicked man takes, or the end which uſually he comes unto; his way is a very ſad way: A godly man is deſcribed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.2.) <hi>Eating the labour of his hands;</hi> that is, the very work which he doth, feeds him; and before he hath any reward for his worke, he finds a reward in his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48478:48"/> work, in which ſenſe, he may well be ſayd, to <hi>Eate the labour of his hand:</hi> On the other ſide, the labour of a wicked man eates him, the labour of his hand, and the labour of his head, eate him out. The way of ſin is a weariſome way (<hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5.) <hi>They weary themſelves to commit iniquity (Ezek.</hi> 24.12.) <hi>Shee hath wearied her ſelfe with lyes:</hi> A Lye is not taken ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there for <hi>an untruth told to deceive others:</hi> A Lye is any ſin, for every ſin is a Lye. Sin tells us a faire tale, but it will deceive us at laſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, (<hi>Iſa</hi> 47.13.) <hi>Thou haſt wearyed thy ſelfe, in the multitude of thy counſells. (Iſa.</hi> 57.10.) <hi>Thou art wearyed in the greatneſſe of thy way.</hi> Thoſe counſels were ſinfull counſels, and theſe waies were ſinfull waies, both were a wearineſſe, and tyred their undertakers. The Lord challenges the Jews (<hi>Mic.</hi> 6.3.) To ſhew wherein he had wearyed them; <hi>O my people what have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearyed thee, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt me.</hi> God is very tender in laying burdens upon us, but we are very cruell in overburdening our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the paine of a wicked man is compared to the paine of a Woman in travaile; it is not onely like it, but exceeds it: For though <hi>when her paine comes upon her, ſhee hath ſorrow becauſe her houre is come, yet when ſhee is delivered, ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth her anguiſh no more, for joy that a Man is borne into the World (John</hi> 16.21.) The Womans paines end in joy, but the paine of a wicked man is ſo farr from ending in joy, that it hath no end at all, and therefore he is ſayd to travell in paine all his dayes. A wicked man hath the paine, but not the deliverance of a travailing Woman; a Son ſhall not be borne to him. And though he ſometimes ſeemes to proſper, and attaine his end, yet there is ſomewhat or other, that ſticks ſtill in the birth, and paineth him in the middeſt of all his proſperity. The Author of that uſefull Hiſtory, <hi>The Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of the old Patriarks, Kings, and Prophets,</hi> when he comes to write the motions of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who was a great King, but of a moſt malitious ſpirit, againſt the people of God, hee obſerves that this <hi>Antiochus</hi> in purſuance of his bloody deſignes, had run more hazzards, and taken more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious journeys to ſatisfie his malice, and reach his ambitious ends, then any of the Saints had done, upon any command or ſervice of God; upon which conſideration, he makes this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48478:49"/> excellent concluſion, <hi>That wicked men take more paines to goe to Hell and eternall deſtruction, then godly men doe in the way to eternall life, and ſalvation. A wicked man cannot goe to Hell with eaſe; he goes with paine to eternall paines.</hi> Thoſe wayes of ſin which have moſt pleaſure in them, have much vexation in them. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.29.) <hi>Who hath woe, who hath ſorrow, who hath wounds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe?</hi> The anſwer is at hand in the next words, <hi>They that tarry long at the Wine, they that goe to ſeek the mixt Wine:</hi> The Wine is ſweet, <hi>but it bites like a Serpent, and ſtings like an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Verſ.</hi> 32. The voluptuous man drinkes larger draughts of ſorrow then he doth of Wine; and while the Adulterer goes to the Harlots houſe, <hi>he goes as a foole to the ſtocks, or as an Ox to the ſlaughter (Pro.</hi> 7.) As pleaſure is the Epicures God, ſo gaine is the covetous mans God, yet to get it, he <hi>pierceth himſelfe through with many ſorrowes,</hi> and falls into a ſnare (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.) Further, as a ſinfull converſation among men, ſo a ſuperſtitious ſervice of the true God, and the ſerving of falſe Gods is full of trouble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The falſe worſhipper travelleth in paine all his dayes: All falſe worſhip hath a tang of baſeneſſe and ſlavery in it;</hi> they that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Devill, in what a wretched ſervitude doe they live? In Popery, what vexatious penances doe they put upon their blinded Votaries? The Goſpel is noble, and the ſervice of it ingenuous, as well as pure or ſpirituall: Chriſt hath not called us to drudgerie, but to liberty. <hi>They are moſt free, who ſerve him moſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What paine the Jewes travelled in when they Apoſtatiz'd from God to Idols, <hi>Tophet,</hi> and the Valley of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> where they offered their Children in the fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant witneſſes. Did God put them to ſuch paine in his ſervice? God called them to offer their Beaſts in Sacrifice to him: But they offer their Children in Sacrifice to that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idol. <hi>Wicked men live under a hard task-maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now beſides all theſe outward paines which either are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants, or conſequents of wickedneſſe: There is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward paine farre worſe then theſe. Inward paine ariſeth ſometimes upon the diſappointment of his hopes. A wicked man is exceedingly pained with labour in the attaining of his end, but he is much more pained with griefe, when he cannot attaine his end; he hangs betweene hope and feare,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48478:49"/> while he is at worke (for he that cannot walke by faith to his end, ſhall meet with feares enough before he comes at it) but when his ſenſe tells him that he cannot come at it, he fals into the gulfe of deſpaire. Beſides this paine of feare that he ſhall not, and that of deſpaire, when he cannot compaſſe his deſignes or ends: He is often afflicted with a feircer paine then either of theſe, even with the gripes and gnawings of his owne evill conſcience for the evill he hath done. This paine followes ſome wicked men all the dayes of this life; and it ſhall be the portion of all wicked men after death. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> aymes at this in the next Verſe, while he ſaith, <hi>A dreadfull ſound is in his eares;</hi> there I ſhall further inſiſt upon it. We have yet another very conſiderable part of the wicked mans miſery held forth in the cloſe of this Verſe.</p>
                  <q>And the number of yeares is hidden to the oppreſſour.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The number of yeares,</hi> ſay ſome, is an Hebraiſme, for few yeares, or yeares that are eaſily numberable; a Childe may tell the yeares of an Oppreſſor, they are ſo few: Hence the words are alſo rendered thus, <hi>Few yeares are layd up for the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor. Maſter Broughton</hi> tranſlates plainely to the ſenſe, <hi>Soone numbred yeares are ſtored to the Tyrant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That wicked Oppreſſors are often ſpeedily cut off by the hand of God (Pſal.</hi> 55.23.) <hi>Blood-thirſty and deceitfull men, ſhall not live out halfe their dayes;</hi> If God ſhould lengthen out the lives of men ſet upon miſchiefe, who could live? 'Tis a comfort for us, as well as a curſe on them, that <hi>Soone numbred yeares are ſtored to the Tyrant, his treaſure is not great in dayes, who dayly treaſures up wrath againſt himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another reſuming theſe words, <hi>Hee travelleth with paine;</hi> out of the former part of the Verſe, reads it thus, <hi>And in the whole number of yeares which are layd up for him, he travelleth in paine:</hi> That is, his whole life is miſerable: As if that which is a truth of all wicked men, were more ſpecially applicable to oppreſſors; That they travell in paine.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Qui vult a multis metui. multos tirre <hi>a</hi> oportet.</note>
                     <hi>They who love to trouble others, ſhall be ſure to meet with trouble themſelves.</hi> He that deſires to be feared, ſhall be often affrayd. Oppreſſors and Tyrants in all ages have experimented this truth; which flowes both from the nature of their unjuſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards men, as alſo from the juſt retaliation of God.</p>
                  <p>Our reading leads us to a further conſideration; <hi>The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yeares is bidden to the Oppreſſor:</hi> That is (as ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound) they are determined, or defined in the ſecret counſell of God. It is under a hidden decree how long his oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power ſhall continue, and when he ſhall receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his oppreſſions: Or rather thus, <hi>The number of yeares of his owne life is hidden to the oppreſſor;</hi> that is, he knows not how long he ſhall liue.</p>
                  <p>But is that any ſpeciall judgement upon the Oppreſſour,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48478:50"/> that the number of his yeares, or how long he ſhall live is hidden to him? Is not the number of a good mans yeares hidden to him? Are not the number of every mans yeares hidden to him? Doth any man know how long he ſhall live? <hi>David</hi> indeed prayes, <hi>Teach me to number my dayes (Pſal.</hi> 90.) and <hi>Make me to know mine end, and the meaſure of my dayes, what it is, Pſal.</hi> 39.4. Yet he doth not deſire to know preciſely the number of his dayes, or time of his end, he onely deſires to know their generall number, or utmoſt extent ſpiritually; namely, that at the moſt they were not many, that ſo he might make a wiſe improvement of his life, and a holy, preparation for his death.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then the number of every mans yeares is hidden to him, how is this reckoned as the peculiar puniſhment of a wicked man, that the number of his yeares are hidden to him? I anſwer, It is true, the number of yeares is hidden from all men, both from good and bad, the Lord hath made that a ſecret. Two numbers are ſecret.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The number of the yeares of the World, when that ſhall end; <hi>Of that day and houre knowes no man, no not the Sonne of man, but the Father onely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The number of the yeares of a mans owne life, or the day of his death is a ſecret which no man knowes, though many have been buſie to pry and inquire into it. But though godly men know not the number of the yeares of their owne lives, yet this is no affliction to them, under which notion it is here ſayd of the Oppreſſor; <hi>The number of yeares is hidden to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A wicked man is thoughtfull about this, how he may live long, not how he may live or doe well; he would fulfill many dayes and yeares in the World, that ſo he might have his fill of worldly profits and pleaſures. He is therefore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to thinke his life hangs upon uncertaine tearmes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is uncertaine of any good beyond this life. A godly man knowes not the number of his yeares, but he knowes by whom they are numbred; that ſatisfies him, be they longer or ſhorter, more or leſſe. But a wicked man would have the account in his owne hand, he would be Lord of all, even of time too, but he cannot, <hi>The number of yeares are hidden to the Oppreſſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48478:51"/>
                  <p>Obſerve hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the number of the yeares of mans life is a ſecret which none knowes but God himſelfe:</hi> And as it is ſo, ſo it is beſt for man, that it ſhould be ſo, The certaine knowledge when our lives ſhould end, would hinder us in many duties and ſervices of our lives. Men would be at a ſtand in their worldly callings, if they were acquainted with the preciſe date of their ſtanding in the World. Our not knowing this, is not ignorance, but neſcience; and were it not for this neſcience, we ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the ſtudy of much profitable knowledge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, our not knowing the number of our dayes, ſtirrs up in us a care of improving every day, and to pray with <hi>David, Lord teach us to number our dayes.</hi> Our not knowing which day ſhall be our laſt, ſhould provoke us to ſpend every day ſo, that we may have comfort if it prove our laſt. It is beſt for us not to know that, the not knowing whereof is a motive to be alwayes doing good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is a great vexation to the oppreſſor, or wicked man to thinke of the uncertainty of his owne life:</hi> The Vulgar makes this Obſervation from the Text, his tranſlation of the Text, <hi>The yeeres of his Tyrannicall power are uncertaine.</hi>

A wicked heart is not more pleaſed in doing evill, then troubled when he is but under a ſuſpition that he ſhall want either opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or time to doe it. This is added to the painefull travell of a wicked man, that he knowes not how long he ſhall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in this paine; for though all his be painefull dayes, yet he had rather continue in paine, then not continue his dayes. But the number of yeares is hidden, or a hidden thing to him.</p>

                  <p>And he ſaith, <hi>A ſound of terrour,</hi> becauſe a ſound carryes feare with it; <hi>Feare is a perturbation of the minde, ariſing from an apprehenſion of ſome approaching evill:</hi> Now, by how much the nearer evill draweth to us, by ſo much doth feare increaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; and then an evill may be ſayd to be very neare us, when we hear the ſound of it. We quickly ſee and feele an Enemy, when once he is come within our hearing. When the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſent a meſſenger to take off the head of <hi>Eliſha, Shut the door</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliſha) and hold him faſt at the doore, is not the ſound of his Maſters feet behind him?</hi> (2 <hi>K.</hi> 6.33.) That is, is not his Maſter neer. And when <hi>Eliah</hi> ſaw the raine at hand, he thus beſpeaks King <hi>Ahab, Get thee up, eate, and drinke, for there is a ſound of abundance of raine</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.41.) So here, <hi>The ſound of terrour,</hi> notes the ſpeedy approach of it; the Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 4.19.) complaines lamentably, <hi>My belly, my belly, I am pained at my very heart, my heart makes a noi e within me</hi> (and why all this?) <hi>becauſe thou haſt heard O my ſoule, the ſound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48478:52"/> and the alarum of Warre;</hi> that is, becauſe now it appeares that the enemy is at hand. When once we heare the ſound of the Trumpet, Warr is not farr off, yea it is even at the door, and death is ready to climbe up at our windows. Uſually the care receives the firſt blow; we firſt heare, and then feele the Sword.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Diphaz</hi> ſaith, <hi>A dreadfull ſound is in his eare,</hi> we may underſtand it two wayes; either firſt, that a wicked man hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſad reports of approaching evill, is greatly troubled; or ſecondly, that a wicked man frames to himſelfe an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſound of evill. His fanſie makes a noiſe, he thinkes he heares the ſound of Drums and Trumpets, the clattering of Armour, and the claſhing of drawne Swords, he heares (as the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> elegantly deſcribes it) <hi>The noyſe of the whip, and the noyſe of the ratling of the Wheels, and of the pranſing Horſes, and of the jumping Clarrets.</hi> Now, whether we underſtand it of the approach of reall dangers, the ſound of which, are a terror to him, or whether we take it for thoſe fantaſtick, pannick feares and Satanicall deluſions, both or either of them render his life uncomfortable, and are the effects of an unquiet, or of a guilty conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A wicked man is alwayes ſubject to feare; he that is a ſervant to ſin cannot but be a ſlave to feare: And he that hath done much evill, ſuſpects much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While we have Peace within, Warr without doth not much trouble, though it much afflict us. And while our hearts, toucht by the ſpirit of God, make us muſick, a ſound of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to the eare is not terrible.</p>

The voice of God walking, was a dreadfull ſound in their eares, becauſe they had not hearkned to the voice of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding. Wicked <hi>Paſhur,</hi> who oppoſed the good Prophet, is branded with a new name (<hi>Jer.</hi> 20.3.4.) <hi>The Lord ſayd, his name ſhall no more be called Paſhur, but Magor-Miſabib;</hi> that is, <hi>Feare round about,</hi> and in the next Verſe, the reaſon is given why this name was given him, <hi>For I will make thee a terrour to thy ſelfe:</hi> He that is a terrour to himſelfe, can no more be without terrour, then he can be without himſelfe. Nor can any thing be a comfort to him, who is his owne terrour. And therefore a guilty conſcience heares a dreadfull ſound, what ſound ſoever he heares: he ever expects to heare bad newes, and he puts fearefull gloſſes and comments upon that which is good.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man interprets all reports in one of theſe two miſchievous ſenſes, either <hi>To the diſcredit of others,</hi>

Upon this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſound, they aroſe and fled. Sometimes a wicked heart creates a ſound, and what the Prophet threatens, he heares, <hi>the ſtone out of the Wall, the beame out of the Timber crying againſt him.</hi> The Story tells us of one who thought that the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the Chimney ſpake, and told tales of him. We ſay in our Proverbe, <hi>As the Foole thinketh, ſo the Bell clinketh;</hi> much more may we ſay, <hi>As an evill conſcience thinketh, ſo every thing clinketh.</hi> As he that hath a prejudice againſt another, takes all he heares ſpoken of him, and all that he heares him ſpeak in

The ſound of a leafe is a pleaſant ſound, it is a kind of naturall muſick. Feare doth not onely make the heart move,<note place="margin">Homines tui non expectato adventu hoſtis, velut tranſſoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi examinantur metu. <hi>Jun.</hi>

                     <hi>As the Trees of the Forreſt are moved with the winde (Iſa.</hi> 7.) but it makes the heart move, if the winde doe but move the Trees of the Forreſt. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells Jeruſalem, <hi>Thy ſlaine men are not ſlaine with the Sword, not dead in Battell (Iſai.</hi> 22.2.) With what then were they ſlaine? And how dyed they; a learned Interpreter tells us how: They were ſlaine with feare, and dyed with a ſound of Battell before ever they joyned Battell. This anſwereth the judgement denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Moſes</hi> in another place (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.65.) <hi>The Lord ſhall give thee there a trembling heart, and fayling of eyes, and ſorrow of minde, and thy life ſhall hange in doubt before thee, and thou ſhalt feare day and night, and ſhalt have no aſſurance of thy life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here ſome may object, Is this the portion of wicked men? Doth a dreadful ſound in their eares afflict their hearts? Have not many ſuch, much peace? and doe they not either ſmile or wonder to heart others complaining of an afflicted ſpirit, and beg prayers for the appeaſing of their troubled conſcience? which are matters they have no acquaintance with, nor knowledge of.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We are not to underſtand the propoſition, as if all wicked men have, or that any wicked man at all times, hath this dreadfull ſound in his eare; but thus it is very often, and thus it may be alwayes: thus it is with many, and thus it may be with all wicked men. A wicked man hath (as we ſay) no fence for it, no priviledge nor promiſe to ſecure him from it.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:48478:53"/>
                  <p>Againe, though ſome wicked men have not this dreadfull ſound in their eares; yea though they have pleaſant ſounds in their eares, like them <hi>who ſang to the Viall, &amp;c. (Amos</hi> 6.) yet firſt, their peace is not a true peace; ſecondly, it is not a laſting peace; thirdly, that which they have, ariſeth from one of theſe two grounds; either from neglect of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, or from ſome defect in their conſciences. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of conſcience from whence this ariſeth is twofold, either firſt, when they neglect to ſpeake to conſcience; conſcience and they never have a word, much leſſe any ſerious confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or diſcourſe; either concerning the ſtate of their hearts, or the courſe of their lives, and then all's peace with them. Secondly, when the ſpeakings of conſcience are neglected, conſcience hath a double voice of direction, and correction; conſcience tells a man what he ought, and what he ought not to doe: conſcience checks a man for not doing what he ought, or for doing what he ought not. Yet many over power and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain conſcience from this office, and never leave oppoſing, till they have ſilenced, yea conquered it: Such as theſe have peace, ſuch a one as it is, and heare nothing but a ſound of delight in their eares, while this ſilence laſteth.</p>
                  <p>Againe, this may ariſe from ſome defect diſabling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to doe its ordinary, or naturall duty. (the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an evill man may have ſome goodneſſe in it) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be conſidered two wayes, either morally, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally; that onely is a morally good conſcience, which is pure and holy, a conſcience cleanſed from the guilt of ſin by the blood of Chriſt; thus no wicked man can be ſayd to have a good conſcience. That is a naturally good conſcience which performes the office or duty to which conſcience is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; conſcience is ſet up in man to performe certaine offices: if the conſcience of a bad man performe them, his conſcience (in that ſenſe) is good.</p>
                  <p>The firſt office or work of conſcience is to obſerve, and take notice of what we doe, conſcience ſhould, as it were, keep a Day-Book, and follow us up and downe with Pen and Inke, to write all our motions.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond worke of conſcience is to teſtifie what we have done, and which way we have moved.</p>
                  <p>A third, is, to accuſe us when we doe evill, and to acquit us
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48478:54"/> when we doe well: Now as a wicked mans conſcience is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes morally evill, becauſe ſtained, and polluted with ſin: So many times his conſcience is naturally evill too; that is, it will neither take notice of, nor check him for his ſin. When the wicked mans conſcience is in this evill ſtate, he thinkes his ſtate good enough, and ſo he is at quiet.</p>
                  <p>Caſuiſts tell us of foure ſorts of evill conſciences, all which may live out of the hearing of theſe dreadfull ſounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A blind ignorant conſcience that cannot diſcerne between morall good and evill.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecure conſcience, which thinkes not of any penall evill.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A dull, lazy, ſleepy conſcience, which hath little or no ſenſe, either of what is done or ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A feared conſcience, which is altogether ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>
                  <p>A conſcience thus diſabled to performe its worke, being either blind, ſecure, ſleepy, or feared, is tame and quiet with the worſt of men. But all this while, though this wicked man hath ſome eaſe, yet he hath no peace; his conſcience while ſeared, is farr enough from being ſetled; his conſcience while aſleep is farr enough from reſt. It is with ſuch, as with ſome ſick men, aske them how they doe, they will ſay, Very well, when as indeed they are ſo ſick, that they know not how ill they are; they take death it ſelfe for health, and their not feeling of paine for the curing of their diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>But when the conſcience of a wicked man is once enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſoftned, and awakned, he cannot but have theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſounds, which will neither give nor let him receive any reſt. Conſcience will awake at laſt, and ſpeak terrible things, conſcience will be a <hi>Bounnerges,</hi> a terrible Preacher, thundring out, not only a chiding reproofe, but a ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and then the wicked will even gnaſh their teeth, becauſe conſcience did no ſooner uſe its teeth, they will gnaw their tongues for ſorrow, becauſe conſcience had no tongue to ſpeak, or they no eares to heare what it ſpake, till it was too late: <hi>A dreadfull ſound is in his eare.</hi>

                  <p>This is a further account of the inward miſery or paine which afflicts the ſpirit of a wicked man.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee looketh not that he ſhall eſcape from darkneſſe.</hi> So Maſter <hi>Broughton.</hi> There are five interpretations given about this darkneſſe, out of which the wicked man beleeves he ſhall not returne.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some underſtand it of the darkneſſe of ſin; but a wicked man cannot be ſayd to deſpaire of that about which he never had any hope,<note place="margin">Pii ſpe ſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant &amp; in ſpem contra ſpem ſperant. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> or deſire.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some underſtand darkneſſe litterally, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the darkneſſe of the night, and interpret thus, <hi>He beleeves
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48478:55"/> not that he ſhall returne out of darkneſſe;</hi> that is, he is ſo haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with feares every night, when he lyes downe, that he thinks he ſhall never live till the morning: This is a good ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others underſtand this <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> to be <hi>death,</hi> he hath a perfect ſound of dread when death comes, becauſe he beleeves not that he ſhall returne out of that darkneſſe. The reſurrection is the conſolation of the Saints, in the midſt of greateſt dangers and thickeſt darkneſſe; becauſe, though they dye, yet they beleeve they ſhall returne out of darkneſſe. But a wicked man, who beleeves, or hopes for nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the time of this life, if he be once caſt into the Grave, either thinkes he ſhall lye there for ever, or if he beleeves he ſhall riſe, yet he doth not beleeve that he ſhall riſe out of darkneſſe, for he ſhall riſe in darkneſſe, and goe downe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A fourth expounds it of internall darkneſſe, the darkneſſe of his ſpirit, or of thoſe miſts and clouds which hang about his minde. A godly man falling into this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doth not actually beleeve he ſhall returne out of it (for ſuch a faith were his returne out of it) but a wicked man as he hath no ground, ſo no poſſibility (continuing in the ſtate he is) to beleeve it. <hi>Saul</hi> had a wofull dark ſpirit, and beleeved not that he ſhould returne out of it, by the helpe of God; therefore he went to a Witch (a Counſellour of the Prince of darkneſſe) for helpe.</p>
                  <p>But fifthly, I rather conceive, as often elſewhere, ſo here, by darkneſſe is meant, outward affliction. When the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er comes upon him, and he is caſt into a ſad darke condition, he hath no faith for himſelfe, that he ſhall returne out of it, or be delivered from it. This is an extreame agravation of the miſerable ſtate of a wicked man, who either hath no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity, or his proſperity is nothing to him, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes it not; but if ever he fall into outward miſery, how great is his miſery, ſo great that he gives himſelfe for gone, a loſt man for ever: <hi>He beleeves not that he ſhall returne out of darkneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a wicked man neither doth, not can beleeve deliverance from evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:48478:56"/>
                  <p>Firſt, He hath no ground to beleeve, promiſes are the foundation of faith. A wicked man may be under promiſes of converſion from his ſin, but he is not under any promiſe of mercy while he continues in his ſin; the whole Book of God yeelds him not (in hat ſtate) any ſpeciall promiſe, for ſo much as a bit of bread; when he hath bread, he hath it from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, not from a promiſe, or but from a generall promiſe. He is fed as a Beaſt is fed, the Lord being the <hi>preſerver of Man and Beaſt:</hi> He cannot have a ſpeciall promiſe himſelfe, not being an <hi>heyre of promiſe:</hi> Therefore when he falls into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he hath no ground to beleeve. Whereas a godly man never hath ſo much ground to beleeve, as when he falls into darkneſſe, becauſe then he hath more promiſes then before; his outward loſſes gaine him the advantage of many ſweet promiſes, which till then he could not plead, for the ſuccour and nouriſhment of his faith. As a wicked man hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God (in the ſenſe explained) at any time; ſo a godly man hath moſt promiſes of God in evill, yea in the worſt of times.</p>
                  <p>And as a wicked man hath no ground to beleeve, ſo he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually <hi>hath no heart to beleeve:</hi> as he hath no reaſon to hope for better things, ſo he hath no courage, his ſpirit ſinks and fails, when his ſtate doth. <hi>Abigall</hi> had no ſooner told <hi>Nabal</hi> that the deſtroyer was comming upon him in his proſperity, but his heart ſunke within him, like a ſtone, and he dyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way preſently.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The beſt of a wicked mans faith (that he ſhall returne out of darkneſſe) is but a preſumptuous fanſie, or meer Foole-hardineſſe. A good man is like a Childe in his Fathers houſe, who takes no care, but caſts all upon his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; in the greateſt ſtorme, he commits the helme to Chriſt as Pilot; he can ſay as <hi>David (Pſalm.</hi> 42.) when he is in trouble, <hi>Why art thou diſquieted O my ſoule?</hi> He cals his ſoule to queſtion, and would have his ſoule give him a reaſon, <hi>Why art thou troubled, my ſoule? hope in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him:</hi> But a wicked man hath no God to hope in, therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, <hi>I ſhall yet praiſe him:</hi> That man cannot caſt his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of cares upon the Lord (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22.) who cares not how he burdens God with his ſins; therefore he muſt beare and ſinke under both burdens himſelfe: He cannot beleeve
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48478:56"/> that he ſhall returne out of the darkneſſe of trouble, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and ſports in the darkneſſe of iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Conſider, this is brought as a proofe of the wofull condition of a wicked man. It is miſery enough, <hi>that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer ſhall come upon him;</hi> but this is more miſerable, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve deliverance from deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That want of faith in time of affliction is more greivous then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction:</hi> It is worſe not to beleeve deliverance, then to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to trouble; as the life of faith is the beſt life, ſo the life of unbeleife is the worſt life. <hi>Deſpaire of good is the greateſt evill:</hi> Faith is not onely the ſupport and reliefe of the ſoule in trouble, but it is the victory and tryumph of the ſoule over trouble. Faith doth not onely keep the ſoule alive, but live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Faith keeps the ſoule fat and in good plight: Faith is a ſheild, both againſt temptation, and affliction. But every blow falls upon the bare skin of an unbeleever; Faith is a ſheild both againſt the fiery darts of the Devill, and (with a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) againſt the fiery darts of God alſo. Let God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe caſt his darts at a Beleiver, Faith ſecures him from hurt, though not from wounds, yea his very wounds, through a worke of faith, ſhall worke his good.</p>
                  <p>It is the comfort of a man that <hi>feareth God, and obeyeth the voyce of his Servants, that while he walketh in darkneſſe and hath no light, he is bid to truſt in the name of the Lord, and to ſtay upon his God (Iſa.</hi> 50.10.) But while a man that doth not feare God, walkes in darkneſſe and hath no light, his miſery is, that he can neither truſt in God till light comes, nor that light will ever come. How happy are the righteous, to whom light ariſeth in darkneſſe? How unhappy are the wicked, who being in darkneſſe, conclude that the light will never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.</p>
                  <p>Faith makes all evill good to us, and all good better; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleife makes all good evill to us, and all evill worſe. Faith (like the Horſe, <hi>Job</hi> 39.19.) laughs at the ſhaking of the Speare; unbeleife trembles at the ſhaking of a leafe. Faith findes food in Famine, and a Table in the Wilderneſſe. In greateſt dangers, faith anſwers, I have a great God; when outward ſtrength is broken, and all lyes a bleeding, faith anſwers, The promiſes are ſtrong ſtill, they have not loſt a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48478:57"/> drop of blood, nor have they a skarre upon them. When God himſelfe apreares angry, faith anſwers, I know how to pleaſe him, and I can goe to one in whom he is, and will be wel-pleaſed for ever. Thus faith pulls out the ſting of trouble, draws out the gall and wormwood of every afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But where faith is wanting, every affliction is full of gall and wormwood, and every trouble vexeth with a double ſting. It ſtings ſuch, as it is a trouble, and it ſtings them more, as they ſee no comfort in, nor way out of trouble. The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of darkneſſe is this, Not to beleeve, <hi>that we ſhall returne out of darkneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And he is waited for of the Sword.</q>
                  <p>This clauſe is neer in ſenſe to the latter part of the former Verſe, and yet in this variety of expreſſion, there is ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of intention. For the clearing of it, two things are to be enquired:
<list>
                        <item>Firſt, What is meant by the Sword.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, What is meant, by, <hi>waited for of the Sword.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sword is taken two wayes in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, litterally for <hi>That weapon of Warr,</hi> and by a Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche the Sword is put for all weapons of Warr; as alſo by a Metonymie, for Warr it ſelfe: When the Sword is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, Warr is threatned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Sword is taken for the power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who beares not the Sword in vaine: Chriſt is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as a King armed with his Sword. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.4.) <hi>By the Sword</hi> (that is with the Word) <hi>of his mouth he will ſlay the wicked:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nempe ſua ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia tradens eum juſtitiae miniſtro.</note> Chriſt will pronounce a ſentence of condemnation, and deliver them up to execution: Thus the Judge ſlayes the Malefactor by the ſword of his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Further, by a Synechdoche, the Sword is taken for all manner of evill and trouble;<note place="margin">Quicquid pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git &amp; percutit, &amp; torquet, &amp; cruciat, in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis ſanctis gladius appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs <hi>Hieron. in cap. ult. Iſa.</hi>
                     </note> whatſoever hurts or afflicts is comprehended under the notion of a Sword (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.35,) Old <hi>Simeon</hi> tells the holy Virgin in his ſong, <hi>Alſo a Sword ſhall paſſe through thy ſoule;</hi> his meaning is not, that ſhe ſhould be cut off in Warr, by the hand of the Souldier, or in peace, by the ſentence of the Judge, but that ſore troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons like a ſharpe Sword ſhould pierce her ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Here the Sword may be taken either for the Sword of War,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48478:57"/> or of Peace, or for any evill, that befalls the Wicked Man.</p>
                  <p>But how is he <hi>waited for of the Sword;</hi> the Originall word is rendered two wayes.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, Actively,</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>Some render actively, <hi>Hee is waiting for of the Sword:</hi> He ſtands expecting the Sword, and that in a double ſenſe;<note place="margin">Circumſpectans undique gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>Vulg.</hi> Sc. vel quo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat vel quo ſe defendat.

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, others render it paſſively, <hi>He is waited for of the Sword,</hi> when he thinkes not of it: The Sword lies in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh to ſurprize him. A man is ſayd to be waited for by an Enemy, when he intends to aſſault him unawares, To be thus waited for by the ſword, is to be waited for by ſword-men. And it is as great a diſadvantage to be ſeen of the Sword, before we ſee the Sword; as it is (according to the old Proverb) to be ſeen of the Wolf, or of the Crocodile, before we ſee either.</p>
                  <p>The wicked is waited for of the Sword, not for any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but for the revenge it owes him, the Sword lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the doore, or under a buſh to ſnap him as he paſſeth.</p>
                  <p>The Septuagint in ſtead of, he is waited, or watched, or looked for by the Sword, render thus, <hi>He is decreed into the hand of the Sword;</hi> leading us to the appointment and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, who hath ſet him out, and marked him for judgement. <hi>Hee is appointed to the Sword:</hi> Such a decree the Prophet ſeems to poynt at (<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.2.) where he brings in the Lord, as reſolved to proceed in judgement againſt all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and intreaties, though made by his greateſt Favorites; <hi>Though Moſes and Samu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>That a wicked man thinks every one his enemy:</hi> He dreames of danger when he ſleeps, and where ever he comes, he waites for the Sword, <hi>He that hath a minde to hurt others, feares it is

                     </note> and while we goe about doing good, we are free from the ſuſpicion of evill. <hi>Cain</hi> having murthered his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, complaines of the Lords ſentence againſt him, <hi>Thou haſt driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face ſhall I be hid, and I ſhall be a fugitive and a Vagabond on the earth, and it ſhall come to paſſe, that every man that finds me ſhall ſlay me, (Gen.</hi> 4.14.) <hi>Cains</hi> complaint is the Comment of this Text, <hi>Every one that findes me ſhall ſlay me,</hi> is, <hi>I wait for, or I expect the Sword: Cain</hi> ſpeaks as if an Army were continually purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, or as if the avenger of blood, were alwayes ready at his heels. And that which aggravates the wonder of this jealouſie, is, that we can give account but of one man alive in the World beſides himſelfe at that time, and that was his owne Father <hi>Adam;</hi> we read not of any Son that <hi>Abel</hi> left behind him, nor had <hi>Cain</hi> any Son (upon record) at that time; and yet he cries out as if the World had been full of Inhabitants, and every one of them his Enemy; <hi>Every one that meets me will ſlay me.</hi> What is ſaid of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> is true of Oppreſſors, <hi>Their hand is againſt every man,</hi> and therefore they have cauſe enough to ſuſpect that every mans hand is againſt them, they are ever <hi>waiting for the Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the paſſive ſenſe, <hi>He is waited for of the Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a wicked man is in danger whereſoever he is:</hi> He cannot ſet his foot over the threſhold but miſchiefe may arreſt him; the Lord ſayd to <hi>Cain, If thou doeſt ill, ſin lyes at the door;</hi> that is, (according to the ordinary interpretation) puniſhment lyes at the door, it lyes at the door, yea it will draw the latch, or turne the Key and come in at the doore; <hi>There is no evill but a wicked man is ſubject to it;</hi> as there is no good, but is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of a godly man, who is therefore called <hi>an heire of the promiſe.</hi> He that is an heire of the promiſe, hath all the good things of this life, and of the next for his inheritance. When he goeth forth, mercy hath him by the hand, yea mercy lyes under his feet, and holds a canopy of protection over his head. A wicked man is an heyre of the curſe, and therefore he alwayes ſtands under the droppings of Divine anger; his breaſt is the Butt or Mark at which God levells the deadly Arrows of his indignation, and <hi>he is waited for of the Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48478:58"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the expectation of evill is more afflictive then the feeling of evill;</hi> He doth not ſay, he is ſlaine with the Sword, or cut off with the Sword; but he is waited for, or he waites for the Sword: All evill attends him who is thus attended, or who gives ſuch attendance. He that is alwayes looking for evill cannot enjoy the good which he ſees. For as the aſſured hope of approaching comfort ſwallows up our preſent ſorrows, ſo the continuall expectation of approaching ſorrow ſwallows up our preſent comforts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is not ſayd either by what Sword or by whoſe Sword he is waited for, but <hi>he is waited for of the Sword;</hi> here is the Sword, but here is no hand named, neither the hand of God, nor the hand of man, drawing and weilding this Sword.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the deſtruction of a wicked man is inevitable.</hi> When we neither know, whoſe the Sword is, nor whence the Sword is, how ſhall we prevent it or provide againſt it.<note place="margin">Cum Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium dicitur &amp; non dicitur a quo inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſit, inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                     </note> When the Lord would aſſure us that an unavoydable overthrow ſhall come upon the Kingdomes of the earth, which oppoſe the Kingdome of Chriſt; he ſaith, <hi>A Stone cut out without hand,</hi> ſhall doe this; it ſhall be done no man knows how or which way; and therefore no man can know how or which way to hinder the doing of it. As there is a Stone cut out without hands, ſo here is a Sword to cut without hands. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Babylon</hi> is thus expreſſed by the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.11.) <hi>Therefore ſhall evill come upon thee, thou ſhalt not know from whence it ariſeth; and miſchiefe ſhall fall upon thee, thou ſhalt not be able to put it off.</hi> The former words expound the latter: Why ſhould not <hi>Babylon</hi> be able to put off the miſchiefe? Becauſe it comes upon her, ſhee knowes not from whence. We ſay in our Proverb, when we threaten a miſchiefe, from which there is no eſcaping, <hi>You ſhall never know who hurt you:</hi> He that knows not who hurts him, ſhall never know how to help himſelfe; and while the hand that ſtrikes us is not ſeen, how ſhall we ſee to defend our ſelves againſt the ſtroke. He that waites for the Sword is alwayes in feare, and he that is waited for by the Sword, is alwayes in danger. Either of theſe is bad enough; and he that is under both, cannot be worſe.</p>

                     <note place="margin">In Hebraeo tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur propane.</note>We put in thoſe words, <hi>Saying,</hi> and <hi>Is it;</hi> the Hebrew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely this, <hi>He wandreth abroad for bread, where;</hi> as if he had ſayd, <hi>No man knowes where, and he knowes not whither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a twofold interpretation of this <hi>Wandering;</hi> ſome underſtand it of a powerfull roaving abroad for bread; he takes what he can from thoſe who are next,<note place="margin">Tyrannorunt farta &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinas hic de ſcnibi putat <hi>Cajetanus.</hi>
                     </note> or he takes what comes next to hand: He muſt have it, it matters not much with him, how or from whom. Such are called <hi>Rovers,</hi> they rove abroad for bread, they ſpoyle and plunder others for the ſupply of their wants, ſhall I ſay, or of their luſts. But I conceive this Expoſition unſuitable; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is not here deſcribing the ſin of a wicked man, but his puniſhment; to ſpoyle and plunder for bread is his ſin; to wander for bread is his puniſhment, and implyes the evill and miſery that comes upon the wicked, not the evill and miſchiefe that is done by the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To wander, is the condition of a man who hath no ſetled dwelling. <hi>Paul</hi> was once in ſuch a ſtate, <hi>Even to this preſent houre we both hunger</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and have no certaine dwelling place</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11.) This alſo was the lot of the Jewiſh Martyrs, <hi>They wandered about in Sheeps-skins, &amp;c. (Heb.</hi> 11.37.) Theſe were <hi>holy wanderers:</hi> They wandered in the World, that they might not wander from God. Here we have an <hi>unholy wanderer,</hi> who having gone aſtray from God, found no reſt among men, a downe-right Vagabond; for ſo the word is applyed to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48478:59"/> 
                     <hi>Cain (Gen.</hi> 4.) <hi>A fugitive and vagabond ſhalt thou be;</hi> and we in our Law, call a ſort of idle Beggars, <hi>Vagabonds,</hi> ſuch as goe from Countrey to Countrey, from houſe to houſe, to ſeek their bread. Such alſo were among the Jewes, who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Vagabond Jewes, (Acts</hi> 19.13.) To be a wanderer was one of the ſharpeſt threats that God ever denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people, <hi>My God will caſt them away, becauſe they did not hearken to him, and they ſhall be wanderers among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>He wanders about for bread.</q>
                  <p>In Scripture ſenſe, bread takes in all good things,<note place="margin">Panis hoc loco non ſignificat, ut aliâs ſaepe, quodcunque eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culentum; ſed viliſſimum quemque cibum quo poſſit ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentari. <hi>Pined.</hi> His verbis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur aliud Dei flagellum nem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe extrema in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia. <hi>Bold.</hi>
                     </note> even the beſt which concern this life: So Chriſt teacheth us to pray, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> But here by <hi>bread,</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaneſt proviſion, diſtinct from fleſh, and other Food; a man that lives meerly upon bread, hath but poore fare; though bread be the ſtaffe of life, yet he that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bread to eate, lives meanely, and hath onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep life and ſoule together.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, they that <hi>wander for bread,</hi> muſt be content with the courſeſt bread, and with a little of that; they are often glad if they get but a dry or mouldy cruſt of bread to ſatisfie the cry of hunger. So then, <hi>To wander about for bread,</hi> is to live a beggars life, or to be driven to the utmoſt ſhifts to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine life, and keep from ſtarving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be brought to a peece of bread</hi> (of our owne) is to be brought to the loweſt ebb in worldly things,<note place="margin">Exul, inops er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res alienaque limina luſtres <hi>Ovid. in Ibin.</hi>
                     </note> (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.26.) <hi>By meanes of a whoriſh woman, a man is brought to a peece of bread;</hi> That is, he is made very poore. And if he be at a low ebb, who hath but a peece of bread of his owne: what are they who are forced to aske ſo low as a piece of bread of others? To want bread is ill, but wonder about for bread is far worſe. He that wants bread is pincht, but he that wanders for it is diſgraced.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve hence, firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To want and wander about for bread, is a ſore affliction;</hi> Such an affliction, as <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth he never obſerved the rightous mans ſeed fallen into (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.25.) <hi>I have been young, and now am old, yet never ſaw I the righteous forſaken, nor their ſeed begging their bread:</hi> The righteous are often troubled, yet never
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48478:60"/> forſaken, or if forſaken of men, yet not of God; when all men, even godly men, forſook <hi>Paul,</hi> yet God did not: <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſtood by me,</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16, 17.) And though a righteous man may be brought to begg, yet his ſeed (that is, his whole poſterity) is not; or if we take ſeed for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon, to ſee him begg for bread is very rare; ſo rare it was in thoſe times, that <hi>David</hi> had not obſerved it; for he ſpeakes not of that which cannot be, but of that which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never ſeen to be. 'Tis a mercy to be denyed ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, but it is an extreame miſery to be denyed neceſſaries.

                     </note> but the Law made ſuch proviſion, that they had no Beggars or wanderers for bread. (<hi>Deut.</hi> 15.) He is not a Beggar that askes bread upon a pinch (for ſo did <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, more then once) but he that makes a trade of it.</p>
                  <p>Poverty or want is not a marke of Gods disfavour, no more then riches are a marke of his love: Yet ſome want and poverty, that eſpecially, which is accompanied with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall wandering for bread, is a mark of Gods disfavour. it was a Propheticall curſe upon the Traytor <hi>Judas</hi> and his Poſterity (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.10.) <hi>Let his Children be continually Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds and begg, let them ſeek their bread out of deſolate places.</hi> And experience tells us, that though ſometimes a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> a good man begg, yet the race and generality of profeſſed Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars are the worſt of mankinde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeakes ſpecially of the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and tells us, that he <hi>wanders about for bread.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Oppreſſion is the neereſt way to poverty: They who make Beggars to ſatisfie their luſts, ſhall be forced to begg for the ſatisfying of their hunger.</hi> It is very dangerous to make proviſion for the fleſh by lawfull meanes, to fulfill the luſts of it; but it is moſt dangerous to make proviſion for the fleſh by unlawfull means (by wrong and oppreſſion) to fulfill the luſts of it. They who ſo fulfill their luſts, ſhall ſoon be brought to want. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> ſung out this ſuddaine change (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>They that were full have hired themſelves out for bread, and they that were hungry ceaſed.</hi> Not that they ceaſed to be, but they ceaſed to be hungry, or their hunger ceaſed. Godly empty ones were filled, and wicked full ones were emptied; and that which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48478:60"/> makes the want and emptineſſe of a wicked man ſo great a miſery, is his want of faith and patience when he is empty; he hath done ſo much evill, that he hath no faith to beleeve, that any man will doe him good, therefore his poverty fills him with impatience, and his minde is more unſetled then his eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſuch as he are deſcribed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.14, 15.) <hi>At even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let them returne, and let them make a noyſe, like a Dog, and goe round about the City: Let them wander up and downe for meat, and grudge if they be not ſatisfied:</hi> A good man may want meat, but he doth not grudge. He that waites upon God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves, ſhall be ſatisfied, though not filled.</p>
                  <p>Againe, 'tis propheſied of wicked men (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.21.) <hi>They ſhall paſſe through it hardly beſtead and hungry, and it ſhall come to paſſe, when they ſhall be hungry, that they ſhall fret themſelves, and curſe their King and their God, and looke upward:</hi> When an unbeleever hath nothing to eate, he eates himſelfe. His owne fretting waſts him more then his hunger. He then <hi>looks upward,</hi> not as ſubmitting himſelfe to God in his hunger, not as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon God, for the ſatisfying of his hunger: In which ſenſe it is ſayd (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.15, 16.) <hi>The eyes of all waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee,</hi> or (as we put in the Margin) <hi>looke unto thee, and thou giveſt them their meate in due ſeaſon, thou openeſt thine hand and ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing.</hi> A wicked man cannot look upward, <hi>thus,</hi> when he is hungry, he cannot look up and pray, he cannot look up and truſt in God; but he looks upward to curſe the God of Heaven in his heart, if not with his tongue; he looks upward, becauſe he is vext with all that is done below; he looks upward, not becauſe he hath any pleaſant ſights in Heaven,<note place="margin">Terroribus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiae ita di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexatur ut in maxima abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damia ſummè egeat, laboret de victu ſupra mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum. <hi>Jun.</hi> Vagatur, vel in mediis opibus, egeſtatis metu, nec partis ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re fruitur. <hi>Merl.</hi>

                  <p>Where? or whither doth he wander? That which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is conceived to aime chiefely at in this paſſage, is not ſo much the reall, as the imaginary and conceited want of a wicked man. He wanders while he ſtayes at home, and ſeekes for bread, while his Barns and Tables are filled with it. He is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with fore-thoughts of poverty, in the midſt of his rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and when he hath bread, ſaith, Where is it? He is ſo
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48478:61"/> troubled with ſuſpected evills, that he cannot take comfort in his poſſeſſed goods.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That abundance cannot ſatisfie:</hi> God onely is fulneſſe to us. A man may wander about in his thoughts for bread, when he hath bread enough about him, and ſay he ſhall be undone, and dye a beggar, when he hath abundance. <hi>A cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man is an unſatiable gulfe; He only is well who hath enough, and he is beſt who hath (in temporalls) the leaſt enough:</hi> But a coveteous man hath not enough, though he hath more then enough, and much more then needs; he always dreams of dearths, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the Earth will be barren: with theſe feares he pines, yea martyrs himſelf, and is not at all enriched with all his riches; he hath ſufficient to maintaine twenty, yet is told by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleife, that he hath not ſufficient for one. This is vanity and vexation of ſpirit; The life of man doth not conſiſt in what he hath, but in what he is, and hopes to be: his life doth not conſiſt in abundance, either for the continuance of it, or for the comfort of it. A man doth not live more dayes, nor more cheerfully any day, becauſe he lives plentifully. The creature were a God to us, if it could do this to us; but this, God hath reſerved in his owne hands (how much ſoever of the creature he gives out) that we may know our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That imaginary wants, or to have an unquiet ſpirit in the midſt of our injoyments, is more afflictive then to be in reall want:</hi> The worſt worldly poverty is to be poore when we are rich; as it is the excellency of our ſpirituall eſtate to be poor in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in our greateſt ſpirituall plenty, to be little or nothing in our own eyes, when we have a great ſtock of grace: So it is the miſery of our temporall eſtate to be thus poor in ſpirit, when we have plenty in the Purſe, to ſay we have little or nothing, when we have a great ſtock of worldly goods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zophar</hi> concludes of the Hypocrite (<hi>Chap.</hi> 20.21.) <hi>In the fulneſſe of his ſufficiency he ſhall be in ſtreights;</hi> which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, either firſt, That when he is full, troubles ſhall empty him; or ſecondly, That while his fulneſſe continues, even in his fulleſt fulneſſe, he ſhall live, as if he were indeed as empty of wealth, as he is of goodneſſe, alwayes ſpending himſelfe with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48478:61"/> feares that all will be ſuddenly ſpent, and ſaying in his heart, <hi>This will not hold out, I ſhall never be able to bring the yeare about, or bring</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>both ends together.</hi> Hence his cares are endleſſe, and he grudges himſelfe ordinary comforts, his worldly ſorrow conſumes him, and he is willing to dye, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſave charges: That man is in an ill caſe, who is grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he eates or ſpends, by others, but it is farr worſe for a man to grudge himſelfe his neceſſary expences.</p>
                  <p>Some worldly men, whoſe Barns are full, are ready to ſay every one to his ſoule, as he (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.19.) <hi>Soule take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods layd up for many yeares:</hi> Another hath his Barnefull, and yet ſaith, This will not hold one yeare, and ſo gives his ſoule no eaſe at all. What the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe, is true of all thoſe who have an intereſt in Chriſt, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>As poore, yet making many rich; as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet poſſeſſing all things:</hi> But there are ſome rich, who make many poore, and themſelves pooreſt of all; for though they have all thoſe things, yet they are as if they poſſeſſed nothing. It is an affliction to be poore for want of riches, but it is a curſe to be poore in the poſſeſſion of riches. <hi>Hee that loves Silver ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver</hi> (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10.) To be ſatisfied, is more then to be rich, and he is alwayes poor who is unſatisfied; he that expects ſatisfaction from the creature, ſhall never finde contentation in the creature; and he that expects no ſatisfaction from the creature, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation in any portion of the creature. A godly man learnes in every eſtate to be content; a carnall man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in no eſtate; when he is poor, he ſees he hath nothing, and when he is rich, he ſaith he hath not enough. Thus he wanders as well when he is rich, as when he is poor, and is therefore never ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Againe,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He wanders about for bread, Where?</hi> Or ſaying, <hi>Where is it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A man that is not good, is uncertaine where to receive any good;</hi> Where is it? Though a Beleever want bread, yet he knowes whither to goe for it, and where it is to be had. <hi>The earth is the Lords and the fulneſſe thereof, he goes to Heaven for bread as well as for grace;</hi> he knowes there is bread in the promiſe, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48478:62"/> to the promiſe he goes. The promiſe hath all things both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning life, and godlineſſe. Chriſt who is the bread of life, gives us bread for this life; and having Chriſt, with him, we have all things elſe; Bread and cloathing, Gold and Silver, are layd up in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>An Unbeleever (as hath been ſhewed) hath nothing to doe with promiſes, nor with Chriſt the fulfiller of promiſes, and therefore he is ever in doubt, when he is in want; and ſaith, Where is it? He knowes not whither to goe, nor to whom for the ſupply of his wants. A wicked man is never in his way, and, in one ſenſe, he is never out of his way. They may goe any where, who know not whither to goe. They are never out of their way, who have no home. Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South, it is all one to them; which way the Staffe falls, they goe, they have no rule nor line to goe by; but though a wicked man know not his particular way, yet he often knowes his generall end, and that is miſery, as the next words tell us.</p>

                  <p>To know, it is here oppoſed to an uncertaine gueſſe, or to conjecture; to know is as much as to be fully perſwaded, to know, is to be aſſured; the higheſt act of faith is often expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by knowledge.<note place="margin">Novit in ſeipſo quod maneat in ruinam.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Many a wicked man growes into an aſſurance of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching miſery:</hi> It is as hard to perſwade ſome wicked men that their ſtate is naught, as it is to perſwade ſome good men that their ſtate is good; yet as many of the Saints conquer unbeleife, and come not onely to have ſome hopes, but high aſſurances, that there is a day of mercy at hand for them, that they are in a preſent happy ſtate, and eternall happineſſe waite for them; ſo a wicked man (after long debate) may have his unbeleife conquered, and though he hath been ſowing pillowes under his owne elboes, though he hath ſlighted all the Counſells, Admonitions, and threatnings of faithfull Freinds, though notwithſtanding all this, he continue long, ſpeaking peace to his owne ſoule, and ſaying, all is well, yet (I ſay) this man may have his unbeleife conquered, and know at laſt that there is a day of darkneſſe ready at hand; when his eyes are opened to ſee what he hath done, and what he hath been; he ſees that God hath rejected all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences, and that he ſhall never proſper in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That for a man to be aſſured of his owne miſery is the height of miſery: Eliphaz</hi> puts it here among the puniſhments of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. This aſſurance makes his heart ſhake, this knowledge is full of feare, and therefore full of torment. As to know that a day of light and deliverance is ready at hand, is light while we are in darkneſſe, and deliverance while we are in trouble: So to know that a day of darkneſſe and miſery is ready at hand, is darkneſſe to wicked men while they are in externall light, and miſery in the midſt of all their mirth. And as it is the higheſt comfort of the Saints to know that they have eternall life, to know that they are in the favour, and live in the love of God; (a man may be in it, and not know it, and then though he ſhall doe well at laſt, yet his ſtate is but uncomfortable, and he that is an heyre of Heaven, may walke as an heyre of Hell, with a troubled ſpirit) but to know that it is ſo, this is Heaven before we come at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo it is the deepeſt ſorrow of any man in this life, to know that he hath eternall death; an aſſurance of this, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the ſpirit (though I conceive a man cannot have an abſolute aſſurance of it, yet to have ſtrong impreſſions

                  </p>
                  <p>As a Beleever, when the eye of faith is cleare, ſees mercy neer at hand (Faith makes God neer, and then all good is neer.) So an Unbeleever when the eye of his conſcience is cleared, ſees miſery neer.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve Fourthly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The miſery of a wicked man is unmoveable:</hi> His day of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is eſtabliſhed by an irrevocable decree, there is no get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it off; he is under a Divine Fate.

                     <hi>Diſtracting feare is the portion of a wicked man:</hi> The troubles of the righteous are many, but their feares are few (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.) <hi>His heart is fixed, he ſhall not be afraid:</hi> 'Tis not ſayd he ſhall not heare evill tydings (I know no man whoſe eares are priviledg'd from ſuch reports) but he ſhall not be afraid. <hi>I will not be afraid of ten thouſands of people, that have set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt me round about, (Pſal.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>Though I walke in the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will feare no evill, Pſ.</hi> 23.4. are the reſolves of faith: Whoſoever hath much feare, hath but little Faith, <hi>Wherefore are ye afraid, O ye of little Faith?

And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>the Saints are more then conquerours through him that loveth them,</hi> wicked men are more then conquered, they are utterly ruined, loſt, and vanquiſhed, becauſe not beloved. There are two battells wherein we cannot ſtand without the ſtrength of Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:48478:65"/>
                  <p>Firſt, The battell of inward temptation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The battell of outward affliction.</p>
                  <p>We are no match for either, unleſſe Chriſt be our Second. <hi>Satan hath deſired thee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter) to winnow thee as Wheate</hi> (hoping to finde, or make thee Chaffe) <hi>But I have prayed that thy Faith faile not: Peter</hi> fell into temptation, yea he fell in the temptation, yet becauſe Chriſt undertook for him, the temptation could not prevaile againſt him. And as there is no conqueſt over Satans temptation, but by the ſtrength of Chriſt; ſo none over affliction (which is Gods temptation) but by the ſtrength of Chriſt (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.) <hi>There hath no temptation</hi> (that is, no affliction) <hi>taken you, but what is common to man</hi> (yet no man can ſtand under that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which may befall any man, therefore it followes) <hi>But God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able, &amp;c.</hi> Man alone is not ſufficient, ſo much as to thinke one good thought, how then ſhall he thinke good thoughts enow alone, either to ſcatter a temptation, or to beare an affliction? To carry the ſoule out in ſuch a conflict requires more then one good thought, yea more then many good thoughts, it requires good actings; yea and ſufferings too; how ſhall he doe this without the ſtrength of Chriſt? No wonder then if the leſſer of theſe, yea the leaſt of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, the leaſt affliction prevaile againſt a wicked man; and if while he runs with Foot-men, they weary him, how ſhall he contend with Horses, with trouble and anguiſh, ſhall not theſe prevaile againſt him, as a King ready to battell? Which is the illuſtration of the wicked mans downefall: <hi>Trouble and anguiſh prevaile againſt him:</hi> But how? Not a little, not with ſtrength onely enough to turne the ſcale of the conflict, but mightily, even with much ſtrength to ſpare.</p>
                  <q>As a King ready to battell.</q>
                  <p>There are foure interpretations for the making out of this ſimilitude; ſome place it between a wicked mans trouble and anguiſh, and the trouble and anguiſh of a King ready to joyne Battell with a potent Adverſary: For, then his ſpirit is much troubled, knowing how great an adventure he makes, in reference to his ſtate, and how great a hazzard he runs, in reference to his life, and perſon. The charge being ſometimes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48478:65"/> given to fight neither againſt ſmall not great, but onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King. So a wicked man when trouble comes, is like a King going to Battell, full of feares and anxious thoughts what the iſſue and event may be: He lookes upon himſelfe as the marke, both of the wrath of God and Man, and that every blow ſhall be directed againſt his breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Trouble and anguiſh ſingle out wicked men; when God ſends out his Armies of judgements, he charges them not to fight againſt the ſmall or great of his owne people, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked of the World: Wrath aymes at them, and therefore they are terryfied at the approaches of wrath.<note place="margin">Praeliaturum regem circun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare ſolebat globus militum ut lectio Tygu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina indicat. Anguſtia &amp; circumvallatio eum circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ut regem conſertis globis praeliaturum.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others give out the ſimilitude, thus, <hi>Trouble and anguiſh ſhall come upon him, as a King ready to battell:</hi> As when a King goes to Battell he is compaſſed with a ſtrong guard. (Every Generall hath his <hi>Life-guard,</hi> much more <hi>Kings</hi>) So, trouble and anguiſh ſhall compaſſe a wicked man, as yet with wideſt difference; for the Guard compaſſeth the King for the ſafety and preſervation of his perſon; whereas trouble and anguiſh gather about wicked men for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: But the Text will hardly admit this explication, and therefore I paſſe it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Hebrew word which ſignifies a day of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, ſignifies alſo a <hi>Spheare,</hi> or <hi>round Globe,</hi> we tranſlate it,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>a Ball (Iſa.</hi> 22.18.) where it is propheſied againſt <hi>Shebna,</hi> that the Lord would make him an example, and that (as the Hebrew is) <hi>Toſſing, he would toſſe him with a toſſing;</hi> that is, he would ſurely toſſe, and turne him like a Ball, into a farr Countrey; as a Ball is toſſed or throwne, ſo the Lord would throw him into Captivity. Now becauſe it is a uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all way of embattailing, to draw an Army into the forme of a Globe, or Ball; therefore the ſame word which ſignifies a <hi>Spheare,</hi> or <hi>Globe,</hi> ſignifies alſo a <hi>Battell,</hi> from the forme of it. Taking it in this ſenſe, for any thing that is round, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as a Ball, or Spheare. This third interpretation of the ſimilitude riſeth thus, <hi>Trouble and anguiſh ſhall make him afrayd, they ſhall prevaile upon him, as a King put in Chaines, or into a hoop of Iron;</hi> ſome labour much for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this interpretation, That <hi>Eliphaz</hi> intends to ſhew how wicked oppreſſors ſhall be ſurrounded and held faſt with trouble, like ſome great Kings, who falling into the hands
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48478:66"/> of their Enemies, have been ſhut up in round Iron Cages, as <hi>Tamerlane</hi> carryed <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Turkiſh Emperour; or bound in Chaines, as it is Propheſied in the 149. Pſalme. It was the uſe of thoſe times,<note place="margin">Declarare vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens extremas impii anguſtias ut illum eo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto undique ſtringi tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus, quo Rex ab hoſte ſuperatus &amp; captus; pro ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaculo publicè ponebatur in Ferricernio. <hi>Bold.</hi> Ita etiam tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum explicat, <hi>Vatablus.</hi>
                     </note> to make <hi>hoops of Iron,</hi> for the ſecuring of Kings and Princes taken in Battell; the formes of which, and how thoſe captivated Kings were lockt up in them, with the poſture of their bodies in that baſe impriſonment, may be ſeen in <hi>Boldue</hi> upon this Verſe; and he annexeth diverſe texts of Scripture, in which he conceives there is an alluſion to this coorſe way of handling Kings.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Our reading compares trouble and anguiſh to a King, ready to Battell; as if he had ſayd, <hi>Trouble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſhall prevaile upon him irreſiſtibly:</hi> This is but a high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of greateſt preparation for a Battell; for when a King goeth forth to Battell in perſon, he will have all the ſtrength of his Kingdome with him, which <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe cleares in the 29. <hi>Chapter, Verſe</hi> 25 where deſcribing his own former felicity, he concludes, <hi>I choſe out their way, and ſat chief, and dwelt as a King in the Army:</hi> That is, in great ſtrength and power. So the Apoſtle ſpeaks (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8.) <hi>You have reigned as Kings without us, and I would to God yee did reigne;</hi> that is, you conceive you have had the confluence of all comforts, and ſtrengths, <hi>You have reigned as Kings,</hi> I would you had, that we alſo might reigne with you, or ſhare in your felicity. So that when <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith, Trouble and anguiſh ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, as a King armed, and ready to ſet forth to Battell; his meaning it; They ſhall prevaile ſtrongly, yea irreſiſtibly. The wicked man ſhall not be able to ſtand their charge, much leſſe repulſe is. Theſe ſeverall explications of the ſimilitude meet in one common truth: That as the wicked ſhall not ſtand in judgement, when God comes to judge all the World; ſo when the Lord ſends forth his judgements upon any part of the World, they are the men that ſhall ſurely fall; trouble and anguiſh ſhall terrifie them, as a King going to joyne Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or as a King taken and captivated in Battell, or as a King conquering and prevailing over his Foes in Battell. Sin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes alwayes upon wicked men, as a King commanding and ruling over them; at laſt, trouble (which is the fruit of ſin) ſhall prevaile upon them as a King oppreſſing and deſtroying them. They who will not ſubmit to the rule of the Law
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48478:66"/> as a King to guide them: ſhall be forced to ſubmit to the curſe of the Law, as a King to puniſh them.</p>

                     </note> who ſaith, he received it from the Tradition of the Jewes, that the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> who were profeſſed Enemies to the Jewes, did lye upon the watch, to take all advantages againſt them, in their march from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and when at any time they turned aſide out of the way, either becauſe of legall uncleanneſſe, or upon any naturall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they would fall upon them and ſlay them; which being done, they cut off that member which had the Seale of the Covenant (Circumciſion) upon it, and with their hands ſtretched out, threw it up towards Heaven, as if they would challenge God himſelfe to revenge their blaſphemy of him, and the contempt of that ſacred Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The hand is taken improperly, or metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; ſo, the power of a man is his hand, the ſtrength of his whole body, ſtate, and minde, may be called his hand; his riches are his hand, his credit is his hand, his wit, and parts, Learning, and Eloquence, are his hand, as there is a power in all theſe. And when it is ſayd here, <hi>He ſtretcheth forth his hand againſt God;</hi> we may underſtand it in that latitude; for a wicked man improves the ſtrength of his body, the power of his Eſtate, his Credit, his Wit, all his accommodations in the way of Rebellion againſt God. A man is ſayd to ſtretch out himſelfe,<note place="margin">Extendere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt omnem adhibere cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad percu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiendum hoſtem aut aliquid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liud aggredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum.</note> when he doth his utmoſt to attaine his end, and makes the moſt of himſelfe to any purpoſe: In ſuch caſes he ſtretcheth all that he is (as we ſay) upon the Tenters; and this all of his put together, is his hand ſtretched out againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>To ſtretch out the hand,</hi> imports foure things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To doe a thing with the utmoſt intention of minde
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48478:67"/> and body, to doe it with all our might and fulleſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Joſhua</hi> being reſolved to bring totall deſtruction upon the men of <hi>Ai, Drew not his hand back wherewith he ſtretched out his Speare, till he utterly deſtroyed all the Inhabitants of Ai (Joſh.</hi> 8.26.) The ſtretching forth of his hand was emblematicall, ſpeaking, or implying that his ſpirit kept up to the height of reſolution, for the ruine of that City and people.</p>
                  <p>When the Scripture ſpeaks of God, acting towards Man, either in a way of judgement or mercy, this phraſe is often uſed, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 6.6.) <hi>Wherefore ſay to the Children of Iſrael, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Aegyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeeme you with an out-ſtretched arme. (Exod.</hi> 14.8.) <hi>The Children of Iſrael went out with an high hand;</hi> and at the ſixt Verſe of the ſame Chapter, the Lord bid <hi>Moſes, Stretch his hand over the Sea;</hi> to ſhew that he was purpoſed to worke a Miracle, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his people. The Prophets are frequent in this language (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.25.) <hi>Therefore is the anger of the Lord kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, againſt his people, and he hath ſtretched forth his hand againſt them:</hi> Read <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Verſe</hi> 12, 17.21. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.25. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.7. In all theſe places when the Lord went with full purpoſe to puniſh, he is ſaid, <hi>To ſtretch out his hand.</hi> Now as when God ſtretcheth out his hand againſt Man, it ſhews his reſolvedneſſe to ſmite, ſo when man ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out his hand againſt God, it ſhews his reſolvedneſſe to ſin, or his actuall ſinning with full intention and ſtrength of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Mans ſtretching out his hand,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Extendere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus conſidentis &amp; potentiam vireſque oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis.</note> ſpeaks the confidence of a man, that he ſhall carry all before him, and win the day; it is uſuall with contenders, eſpecially with Souldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they joyne Battell, to ſtretch their hands out, to draw and brandiſh their Swords, in token both of their courage to fight, and of their confidence to prevaile. Obſtinate ſinners are full of falſe hopes that they ſhall obtaine what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and proſper in their projects of wickedneſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſayd to ſtretch out the hand againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Stretching out the hand,</hi> is a poſture of pride and impudence; pride is written upon a ſtretched-out-hand. To ſin preſumptuouſly,<note place="margin">Anima quae in manu ſuperbiae. <hi>Sept.</hi>
                     </note> is in the Originall to ſin <hi>with a high hand (Numb.</hi> 15.30.) The <hi>Septuagint</hi> render that place, <hi>The ſoule
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48478:68"/> that in the hand of pride thinkes ſo, ſhall be cut off:</hi> The <hi>Caldee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe</hi> gives it thus; <hi>He that ſins with an uncovered head;</hi> An uncovered head is an argument of boldneſſe, and that he who acts, cares not who ſees him. Modeſty cauſeth us to hang downe, or cover the head, when we have done ill, and ſhame makes us cover the head when we receive evill, or are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.4.) <hi>The Plowmen were aſhamed, they covered their heads becauſe the ground was chapt: for there was no raine in the Earth:</hi> So that to do, or ſuffer with an uncovered head, is like doing or ſuffering with a high, or ſtretched-out-hand, boldly, preſumptuouſly, and as it were, hanging out a Falg of defiance againſt the God of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Stretching out the hand,</hi> is the poſture of a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maddman; he that wants the uſe of his reaſon, makes this uſe of his hand, laying about him, as if he would doe wonders; ſuch madneſſe lodgeth in the hearts of debauched ſinners, they doe they know not what; they rage and are fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as if they would pull God out of Heaven, and throw the Houſe, yea the World, out at the Windows: Theſe ſtretch their hands againſt God, and they doe it three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Againſt the very being of God; ſuch a wicked man oppoſeth God as God, he wiſheth there were no God, or that himſelfe were God; he would have all power in his owne hand: <hi>Francis Spira</hi> in his deſpayring diſtraction ſayd, <hi>I would I were above God:</hi> In him nature ſpake her mind plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not in Parables: Nature heightned in wickedneſſe would be above God; therefore a carnall man is called, <hi>A hater of God:</hi> Now that which we hate we would deſtroy, and take out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a ſtretching out the hand againſt God, not onely in this open bold challenge, or profeſſed oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this very few will owne. Few Atheiſts will ſpeak out their blaſphemy, or ſend their Trumpet to defie God; and moſt wicked men take a ſuſpicion of this, as the higheſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and affront that can be put upon them. What? They oppoſe God? They ſtretch out their hand againſt God? They will tell you, they love God, and it may be they will tell you that God is their God, and yet will be found ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>retching out their hand againſt God: therefore not onely doe his profeſſed Enemies ſtretch out their hand againſt God, but even thoſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48478:68"/> his profeſſed Friends, who live in the open violation of his righteous Laws; they who oppoſe the will and Word of God, the Statutes and Ordinances of God, theſe will be found to ſtretch forth their hand againſt God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The Lord complaines (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.13.) <hi>Your words have beene ſtout againſt me:</hi> Who? we ſtout againſt God? when did we ſpeak againſt God? we never had ſuch a thought in our hearts, much leſſe, ſuch words in our mouthes: So it followes, <hi>Yet yee ſay, What have we ſpoken ſo much againſt thee?</hi> The Lord tells them (becauſe it ſeems they could not) <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14 <hi>Yee have ſayd it is a vaine thing to ſerve the Lord, and what profit have we, that wee have kept his Ordinances, and yee call the proud happy, &amp;c.</hi> To ſpeak, or thinke thus (though ſuch a word be not ſpoken formally, as it is probable they did not) is to be ſtout againſt God. To ſay, <hi>It is a vaine thing to ſerve the Lord,</hi> is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a diſſervice, but a Rebellion againſt the Lord: To ſay, <hi>There is no profit in keeping his Ordinances,</hi> is the higheſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of his Ordinances; to call, <hi>The proud happy,</hi> is to ſtretch out the hand againſt God, for he ſtretcheth out his hand againſt, and reſiſteth the proud.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The hand is ſtretched out againſt God, when it is ſtretched out againſt his people, his Servants, or any that are under his tuition, and ſpeciall protection; to oppoſe, or ſtretch out the hand againſt theſe, is to ſtretch out the hand againſt God. The Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſets forth both the care of God to keep his people from trouble, and his Sympathy with them in trouble, by an elegant Similitude: <hi>Hee that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye (Zach.</hi> 2.8.) What part is more ſenſible of the leaſt hurt, then the eye, or being hurt, cauſeth a greater ſmart? God is as tender of his people as any man is of his owne eyes. <hi>He that toucheth them, ſc.</hi> to wrong or vexe them, toucheth the apple of Gods eye, he lifts up his hand againſt Gods face, and againſt the moſt excellent part of his face, his eye, and againſt the moſt excellent part of his eye, the apple of it or ball of the eye which is the proper inſtrument of ſeeing. We uſe to ſay, There is no ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the eyes; men doe not like it, to have their eyes played with: Surely then God will not beare it,<note place="margin">Dicimus vulgo cum oculis non ludendum eſt.</note> that any ſhould ſmite or wound his eyes. And he interprets any hurt done to his people, as done to his owne eye, yea to the apple
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48478:69"/> of his eye. When it was under debate in the Councell what ſhould be done with the Apoſtles, <hi>Gamaliel</hi> adviſes, <hi>Refraine from theſe men, and let them alone,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Leſt haply yee be found to fight againſt God (Acts</hi> 5.38, 39.) Some poſſibly would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, We fighters againſt God? We love God; here is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of turbulent Fellows called <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who diſquiet the City, may we not puniſh them, but we muſt preſently be judged fighters againſt God? No, ſaith <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> you fight againſt God, if they and their Apoſtleſhip be of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> was zealous of the Law, and (as he thought) for God; yet Chriſt rebukes him from Heaven, with <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Thou ſtretcheſt forth thy hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, when thou doſt it againſt the Saints; then, there is a ſtretching out the hand againſt God, not onely by a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous oppoſition of God, As <hi>Pharoah, Senacharib,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> did, but by oppoſing the wayes or word, the Meſſengers or Servants of God.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Though every ſinne be againſt God, yet ſome ſinnes are more againſt God:</hi> Wee cannot ſay that every one who ſins, ſtretcheth out his hand againſt God; there is a difference of ſins in degree, though they are all in their nature deadly; there is a preſumptuous ſin, a ſin committed with a high hand, which hath theſe two things chiefely in it.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, A ſinning againſt cleare light.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, A ſinning with full conſent and ſwindge of will.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In that place of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where this ſin is deſcribed (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15.30.) There are two other Characters put upon it: Firſt, it is called, <hi>A reproaching the Lord:</hi> And ſecondly, a deſpiſing <hi>of the Word of the Lord;</hi> Every ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Word of the Lord, but every ſin is not a deſpiſing of the Word of the Lord; every ſin is diſpleaſing to God, but every ſin is not a reproaching of God: Every ſin, even the leaſt, is a departure from God, but ſome ſins are full of activity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</p>
                  <p>It is conceived, that the <hi>preſumptuous ſin</hi> in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the ſame with, or anſwers to, <hi>the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt</hi> in the New; and that which leads to this apprehenſion is, becauſe no ſacrifice was appointed for that under the Law,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48478:69"/> as this is ſayd to be unpardonable under the Goſpell. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> is expreſſe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 10.26.) <hi>If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins.</hi> The Goſpell knowes but of one Sacrifice for ſin, and that but once offered; they who deſpiſe that, have deſpiſed all, for there remaines no more Sacrifice for ſin. God will not ſend his Son to dye a ſecond time for thoſe who have trodden the Son of God in his death under foot, and have counted the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant an unholy thing. God indeed ſtretcheth out his hand all the day long, to a gaineſaying and rebellious people, that is, to thoſe who ſtretch out their hands againſt him in his Law: But he will not ſtretch out his hand (unleſſe to ſmite) to a gain-ſaying and rebellious people, who (in this ſenſe) ſtretch out their hands againſt him in the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the connexion of this Verſe with the former:</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God proportions the puniſhment of man unto his ſin:</hi> There is a twofold proportionating of puniſhment to ſin.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, In the quality, or manner of it.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, In the quantity, or degree of it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The Juſtice of God is viſible in both, according to the exact rules of retaliation: As I have done, ſo the Lord hath requited me, ſayd <hi>Adonibezek (Judg.</hi> 1.) He was puniſhed in the ſame manner that he had ſinned, and ſo have many others. But all ſhall be puniſhed in the ſame degree that they have ſinned. If ſin be great, ſo ſhall the puniſhment of it be. When the iniquity of the Amorite was full, he had his fill of wrath. <hi>When God himſelfe was preſſed with the ſin of Iſrael, as a Cart with Sheaves:</hi> then he layd on load in judgement. If any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why the wicked man ſhould be hurryed, troubled, vexed, why he travelleth in paine all his dayes; he may ceaſe to wonder, when he reads, that the wicked man ſtretcheth out his hand againſt God. Is it any wonder God ſhould ſhew himſelfe an Enemy to them, who practice the Enemy againſt him? Or that they ſhould be higheſt in ſuffering, who have been higheſt in ſin? The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> reproves and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of thoſe, <hi>who made the Ephah ſmall, and the Shekel great (Chap.</hi> 8.5.) That is, who abated the meaſure, and enhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48478:70"/> or raiſed the price of their commodities: But if man make the <hi>Ephah,</hi> or meaſure of his ſin ſmall, God will not make the <hi>Shekel</hi> of his puniſhment great. The wages which the Juſtice of God payes the ſinner, ſhall not be a penny more then his ſinning worke hath deſerved.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that the ſtretching out the hand againſt God, is a ſin againſt light.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ſins committed againſt light, leave the ſoule in the greateſt darkneſſe:</hi> A ſin committed in the darkneſſe of ignorance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves yet to be puniſhed with darkneſſe, even with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting darkneſſe; much more thoſe ſins which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not onely in, but againſt the light of knowledge. Some ſhall periſh for want of light; they cannot but periſh who live and dye in the abuſe of light. Many ſhall periſh becauſe they have not ſtretched forth their hands according to the light received, to worke for God; how deeply then ſhall they periſh, who in the midſt of received light, ſtretch out their hands to work wickedneſſe againſt God?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> deſcribes the wicked man ſtretching out his hand; that is, all the power which God hath truſted him with, to provoke God with.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That wicked men abuſe the good gifts of God, and turne them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God himſelfe:</hi> They uſe their hand, properly taken, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; as alſo their metaphoricall hand, their whole ſtrength againſt God; they ſtretch their authority, their high places, their parts, and wits againſt God; they forme wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons out of all the good gifts of God, to fight againſt God; ſuch ſinning is out of meaſure ſinfull. The idle Servant was condemned, who did not employ and improve the one Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent which he had received, to his Maſters advantage; of how much ſorer condemnation ſhall they be thought worthy who employ their many Talents to their Maſters loſſe, and diſadvantage?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sin is the greateſt evill. That muſt needs be the greateſt evill which oppoſeth the greateſt good:</hi> God is the greateſt good, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin is againſt God, and ſome ſins directly oppoſe God. The Apoſtle argues the evill of ſin, from the oppoſition it makes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48478:70"/> againſt us (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11.) <hi>Dearely beloved, I beſeech you as ſtrangers, and pilgrims, abſtaine from fleſhly luſts</hi> (he doth not ſay, which fight againſt, or diſhonour God, but) <hi>which warr againſt the ſoule:</hi> We have no reaſon to be dallying with luſts, or to be freinds with them, when we heare that our luſts warr againſt us; but when we remember that our luſts warr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, we ſhould not onely abſtaine from them, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr them. Every thing is by ſo much the worſe, by how much that is better which it is contrary unto: There are foure conſiderations which heighten the evill of ſinne upon this account, that it is a ſtretching out of the hand againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Stretch out a hand againſt God! No man ſhould dare ſo much as to lift up a word againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Stretch out a hand againſt God! No man ſhould dare ſo much as to lift up a thought againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Stretch out a hand againſt God! Every man ought to fall downe before God, and be well pleaſed with whatſoever God ſaith or doth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Every man is bound to ſtretch out heart and tongue, and hand, to thinke and ſpeake and doe for God, and when all this is done, we have done but our duty, and the utmoſt that any man doth or can doe in theſe, is not halfe his duty. How wide then is he from, how oppoſite to his duty, who ſtretcheth out his hand againſt God? <hi>And</hi> (as it follows in the next words.)</p>

                  <p>Firſt, All power; <hi>Shaddai</hi> is he that hath power to doe all things: Omnipotency is one of the incommunicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God:<note place="margin">Qui omnia po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.</note> All the power of man is of his giving, but he hath not given all power to any man, no nor to all men. Onely Chriſt as Mediator, or <hi>God-man</hi> hath all power given to him. It is not the will of God to doe all that is in his power, but it is in his power to doe whatſoever he will. If the wicked mans power were ſuch, what worke would he make? If he could doe as much as himſelfe pleaſeth, he would doe nothing, which ſhould pleaſe either God or good men.</p>

Some Princes thinke they have power enough to doe what they will, but they muſt doe it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens hands. Though they have a civill power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to command all, yet they have not a naturall power, ſtrength, or ability to execute all. God hath both theſe powers, he hath abſolute authority to command all to ſerve and help him; and he hath ſuch an abſolute ability, that he needs none to ſerve or helpe him: He that made the World alone, what cannot he doe alone? God calls for our helpe that we may have the honour of it, not that hee hath any want of it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Qui ſufficit omnibus aliis.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Shaddai</hi> is he who hath not onely enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48478:71"/> but for all others; the five wiſe Virgins had Oyle in their Lamps, and they had enough for themſelves, but they had none to ſpare, they could not furniſh the five fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. But the Lord God Almighty hath ſtrength and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for all that come to him, and call upon him: As he is ſelfe-ſufficient, ſo he is all-ſufficient; his Ocean can quickly fill all our empty Veſſells, and his treaſury ſupply and beare all our charges. This Almighty God, who hath power to doe what he pleaſeth, who hath all this power in himſelfe, and who hath power enough to give out to all that need, and aske it of him; this is <hi>the Almighty,</hi> againſt whom the wicked man ſtrengthens himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That the heart of man is very buſie to arme againſt God:</hi> As when a people are threatned with an invaſion, they then ſtrengthen themſelves, they lay in their Proviſions of Warr, and get Forces in a readineſſe: even thus doth the heart of man: Man hath three uſuall wayes of ſtrengthening himſelfe againſt the Almigty. Firſt, By carnall pleas and reaſonings. He pretends reaſon for what he doth; and hee ſtrengthens himſelfe againſt all that God ſaith, by reaſon: he ſets up reaſon againſt that Law which is the quinteſſence of reaſon, and will not be madd but by reaſon, ſuch as it is, and that is, ſuch as he is, a madd one. Theſe reaſonings are <hi>the ſtrong holds</hi> ſpoken of by the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God to the pulling downe of ſtrong holds, caſting downe imaginations, and every high thing, that exalteth it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God:</hi> As the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of this warfare are not carnall but ſpirituall, ſo the ſtrong holds which theſe caſt downe, are not corporeall, but carnall; they are not made of Stones, and Timber, of Earth, or Iron, but of the ſubtiltyes, ſlights, excuſes, ſubterfuges, and arguings of fleſhly minded men. All which the Apoſtle wraps up in the latter words calling them <hi>imaginations,</hi> or <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations, and high things;</hi> that is, ſuch things as are formed in the high and proud conceits of the creature exalting it ſelfe againſt the ſound and ſaving knowledge of God: Such as theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Others doe ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Great ones doe ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48478:72"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This is the cuſtome of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>If I ſhould not doe ſo, I ſhould diſhonour, yea and undo my ſelfe: And why ſhould I refraine what others doe, or what would be my owne undoing?</hi> No reaſon for any of theſe. Thus he ſtrengthens himſelfe againſt the Almighty: his reaſon (ſuch as it is) will beare him out.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſtrengthens himſelfe againſt God upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of mercy from God; why may not I doe thus? God hath mercy for ſinners, why not for me though I ſin? The Apoſtle cautions the <hi>Epheſians (Chap.</hi> 5.6.) againſt ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vaine words, for becauſe of theſe things, the wrath of God comes upon the Children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:</hi> It is good to plead mercy to ſtrengthen Faith, that ſin committed ſhall be pardoned; but woe be to thoſe, who plead mercy to ſtrengthen themſelves in the committing of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others ſtrengthen themſelves againſt the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with hopes of worldly gaine, and they incourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in an evill matter, with promiſes of good; <hi>Wee ſhall finde all precious ſubſtance, we ſhall fill our houſes with ſpoyle, caſt in thy Lot among us, let us all have one Purſe:</hi> Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonates the inticements of ſinners (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.13, 14.)</p>
                  <p>As a gracious heart ſtrengthens it ſelfe for God:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By the promiſes of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By the experiences which himſelfe, or others have had of Gods diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By conſidering the nature of God, how gracious, how good, how powerfull, how faithfull he is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By remembring his relations to God; he is my Father, my King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Shall I not venture to doe or ſuffer for him?</p>
                  <p>Now (I ſay) as a gracious heart ſtrengthens it ſelfe for the Lord, or (as the Apoſtle adviſeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>Grows ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, putting on the whole Armour of God:</hi> So a wicked heart ſtrengthens it ſelfe againſt the Lord, or grows ſtrong againſt the Lord, and the power of his might, yea of his Almightineſſe, putting on the whole Armour of the Devill, that he may be able to ſtand againſt all the encounters of the Word, and of his owne conſcience. For as the Word of God, and the graces of the ſpirit are the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48478:72"/> and weapons by which the Saints ſtrengthen themſelves againſt Satan; ſo carnall reaſonings and the luſts of the fleſh, are the Armour and weapons by which wicked men ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelves againſt God.</p>
                  <p>A wicked mans chiefe care is to fortifie and incourage his luſts; to put warme cloaths to his ſinfull heart, and make it ſtout againſt God: <hi>Sin begins with turning the heart from God, and ſin ends in turning the heart againſt God:</hi> The firſt ſtep in ſin is a neglect of God, the ſecond ſtep is contempt of God, the third and laſt is a Warr with God: He ſtrengthens himſelfe (for the Battell) againſt the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sin runs us againſt reaſon, and cauſeth us to act not onely wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, but fooliſhly:</hi> Is it not folly and madneſſe for weakneſſe to contend with Omnipotency? When a ſinner hath ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe the beſt he can, the very weakneſſe of God (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) is ſtronger then he. <hi>What King</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.31.) <hi>going to make Warr againſt another King, doth not firſt ſit downe, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſayd, The Kings of the Earth are not ſo fooliſh, ſo brainleſſe, and counſelleſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with thoſe, whom they cannot match; they will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venture a Battell with ten thouſand againſt twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſond, they will rather make a diſadvantageous Peace, then proceed in a Warr upon ſuch diſadvantages. The King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> reproved the challenge which the King of <hi>Judah</hi> ſent him, by the Parable of the Thiſtle in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> aſpiring to match with the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.9.) Whats a Thiſtle to a Cedar? Then what is man to God? See then what a reaſonleſſe, yea ſenſeleſſe creature man is, who will needs goe out againſt God to Battell, though all the number he can muſter, is not onely as diſproportionable as ten thouſand to twenty thouſand, as a Thiſtle to a Cedar, but more then one ſingle man is to a Million of men, or then a bruiſed Reed to the ſtrongeſt Oake. God with eaſe made all the power of man alone, and he, though alone, can more eaſily deſtroy it: it coſt him but the ſpeaking of a word to ſet it up, and he can pull it downe with, yea without a word ſpeaking. Many men have been ſtyled, <hi>The great, The ſtrong, The mighty:</hi> But no man ever durſt owne this ſtyle, <hi>The Almighty:</hi> This title of God in the Text, <hi>The Almighty,</hi> ſhould make <hi>the mightieſt of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48478:73"/> men,</hi> the <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the World afraid to meddle, yea to think a thought of medling with God. The abſurdity of men in ſtrengthening themſelves againſt the Almighty, may appeare yet more diſtinctly in three particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He that is Almighty is ſtronger then All; there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be two Almighties. Hence the Apoſtle argues (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) <hi>Will you provoke the Lord to anger, are you ſtronger then he?</hi> It is baſe and cowardly to provoke thoſe that are weaker then our ſelves; it may give us trouble enough to provoke thoſe who are as ſtrong as our ſelves, but it is either madneſs or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratneſſe to provoke thoſe who are ſtronger then our ſelves. And when the Apoſtle demands, or rather expoſtulates, <hi>Are yee ſtronger then he?</hi> His queſtion cals for this poſitive aſſertory anſwer, we are infinitely weaker then he; and therefore there is no prevailing againſt him, not onely not in all things, but not in any thing. It is poſſible for a weake Enemy to prevaile ſometimes upon a mighty Enemy. The <hi>Romans</hi> who commanded the world for many ages, and were too ſtrong for any Nation, did yet receive ſome foyles; though they were never conquered, yet they were ſomtimes worſted, not only by ſurpriſals and Ambuſcadoes, but in the open field; and even petty Princes gave checks for a while, to ſome of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. But <hi>El-Shaddai,</hi> the Almighty God, never received any defeat, nor is he within the poſſibility of a ſurprize.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Not onely cannot the Lord be defeated, but he cannot be endammaged; he never loſt (as we ſay) ſo much as a haire of his head, nor did he ever ſuffer ſo much as the ſcratch of a Pin. The <hi>Romans</hi> obtained ſome Victories with ſuch extreame loſſe and hazzard, that it hath been ſayd, Two or three more ſuch Victories, would utterly undoe them; they who were never defeated or foyled, have yet been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endammaged in Battel; and their cleareſt gains have not bin without ſome loſſe: but the Almighty never loſt the worth of a thread, or drop of blood, in all thoſe innumerable Victories which he hath gained.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Man cannot ſo much as hinder or retard the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of God. He tranſcends all the impediments, and throws open all the Barracadoes that are ſet in his way. <hi>He will worke and who ſhall let him? (Iſa.</hi> 43.13.) There is no putting of a barr in his way; and therefore if any ſhould anſwer the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48478:73"/> 
                     <hi>Who ſhall let it?</hi> Yes, there are ſome will let it, the great men, the Nobles of the Earth, ſay no; they will let it. But they ſhall not, ſaith God, in the next Verſe (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 14.) <hi>For your ſake</hi> (ſpeaking to his people in Captivity) <hi>I have ſent to Babylon, and have brought downe all their Nobles.</hi> The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall word for Nobles, ſignifies alſo <hi>Barrs,</hi> the Barrs of a door, or Caſtle gate, as we put in the Margin of our Bibles; to note, that Nobles and great men ſhould be the ſtrength of a People, and a ſtop to the entrance of any evill among them: but if in ſtead of that, they prove like <hi>Barrs,</hi> onely to hinder the good of a People, and to lye croſſe in all publike procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; then the Lord, the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, brings them down, and breaks them all to peeces. <hi>I will worke, and who ſhall let it?</hi> The Nobles, the Bars ſhall not, though Bars of Iron, to Gates of Braſſe.</p>
                  <p>It was ſayd in opening the words, that ſtretching out the hand is the poſture of a madd man: Conſider this, and then ſay, Is it not the maddeſt madneſſe to ſtretch out the hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, or to ſtrengthen our ſelves againſt the Almighty, to oppoſe him, againſt whom it is impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſible not onely to prevaile, but to doe him the leaſt hurt, or give him the leaſt check or ſtop in his way? If wee ſhould ſee a man ſet his ſhoulder againſt a Wall of Braſſe, or blow a Feather againſt it, hoping to overturne and batter it downe, would not we ſay, this man is either a Fool, who never had the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or a Mad-man, who hath loſt his reaſon? He that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the counſells and wayes of God, can no more overthrow them, then a Feather can a Wall of Braſſe, or the touch of a little finger, the ſtrongeſt Tower. The Pſalmiſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with theſe ſimple attempts (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.) Why doe the Gentiles rage, and the people imagine a vaine thing?

                  <p>There is a difference among Interpreters about that Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, ſome underſtand <hi>God:</hi> As it the meaning were, God runneth upon a wicked man, like a ſtrong Warrier, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible ſwiftneſſe and irreſiſtible force, to caſt him downe. The wicked man having ſtretched out his hand, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe againſt the Almighty, now the Almighty runs upon <hi>his necke, even upon the thick boſſes of his Buckler;</hi> Come ſaith God, <hi>I will have about with thee, if thou dareſt, I will try it out with thee, I am not afrayd of thy ſtiffe necke, though it hath Iron ſinews, nor of the thick boſſes of thy Buckler, though they be of Steele.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ſome, both later Writers, and ancient Rabbins, give the ſenſe, but I rather conceive (with others) that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſtill proſecutes the ſtrange progreſſe, and hightned wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man, who having ſtrengthned himſelfe, by hardning his heart againſt God, <hi>runs upon him, even upon his necke. &amp;c.</hi>

According to our reading (which keeps cloſer to the Original) <hi>Eliphaz</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the ancient and preſent forme of Bucklers, which as they are defenſive weapons, ſo alſo offenſive, and therfore have not only Boſſes for ornament, but (one eſpecially in the center or middle with a ſharpe pike in it) for uſe: For as the whole Buckler ſecured the body againſt the Arrow or Sword of the Adverſary, ſo if he preſſed neer, this high Boſſe, or Pike of the Buckler ſerved to pierce and wound the Adverſary. So that while the wicked man is ſayd to <hi>run upon God, even upon the thick boſſes of his Buckler;</hi> it ſhewes the higheſt valiancy of a wicked man in oppoſing God; he fights not onely afarr off, but neer at hand, and preſſes upon him, though within the reach and danger of his Weapon.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no danger can keep a wicked man off from ſin:</hi> Like the Horſe in this Book (<hi>Chap.</hi> 39.22.) <hi>He mocketh at feare, and is not afrighted, neither turneth away from the Sword; hee ſwalloweth the ground with fierceneſſe and rage, he ſaith among the Trumpets, Aha, aha:</hi> though God have a Buckler, man will come upon him; yea though God have a Boſſe upon his Buckler to ſtrike and wound him, yet on he comes. The Buckler of God
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48478:76"/> is the Law or Word of God, and the Boſſes of this Buckler, are the threatnings and curſes of the Law.

God ſent a word to <hi>Pharaoh, Let my people goe;</hi> this was a Buckler; <hi>If thou refuſe to let them goe, I will ſlay thy firſt borne,</hi> this was the Boſſe. <hi>Adam</hi> run upon the Boſſe of the Buckler, ſo did <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and ſo doe all wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſinners.</p>
                  <p>A wicked heart will goe on ſinning, whatſoever God is ſpeaking, or doing (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17.) <hi>I was wrath, and ſmote him, yet he went on frowardly in the way of his heart:</hi> Neither the wrath of God, nor their owne ſmart ſtopt their progreſſe, though ſmitten, yet they went on. Saints ſometimes goe on ſinning, though God be ſmiting, they have run upon the Boſſes of the Buckler, to the wounding both of their ſoules and of their outward comforts; wicked men will run upon them to the damning of their ſoules and bodies. Though they ſee, yea feele the boſſes, judgement not onely threatned, but executed, yet on they will, and (like wicked <hi>Ahaz) in the time of their affliction ſin more againſt the Lord.</hi> This is the height of ſinfulneſſe. As it ſhewes the truth and height of holineſſe in the Saints, when they will not onely run to God in faire times, when men approve, but in the worſt times, when men oppoſe; when they venture to doe their duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bucklers of men, yea upon the Boſſes of the Buckler, extreameſt danger: So it ſhewes a like ſtrength and height of wickednes, when men venture upon the Boſſes of the Buckler, upon the point of the naked Sword of Gods diſpleaſure; they will venture, let it coſt what it will, though the Lord ſet a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48478:76"/> flaming Sword in the way of luſt, as he did in the way of the Tree of life (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.) though the Lord ſet an Angell with a drawn Sword in the way of luſt, as he did in <hi>Balams</hi> way, when he was going to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet on they will: Till the heart be changed, neither Swords, nor Bucklers, nor Boſſes, neither wrath threatned, nor executed, can cauſe a ſinner to change his courſe.</p>
                  <p>This the Prophet complaines of (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>The people turneth not to him that ſmiteth them, neither doe they ſeek the Lord of Hoaſts:</hi> Their incorrigibleneſſe under ſevereſt corrections is elegantly deſcribed by another Prophet, enumerating five ſpeciall ſtroakes or ſmitings, to every one of which he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes, <hi>Yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord, Amos</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. &amp;c. <hi>When the bellows were burnt, and the lead conſumed of the fire</hi> (that is, when all inſtruments and meanes of refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them were ſpent and worne out, yet their droſſe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them) <hi>The Founder melted in vaine, for the wicked</hi> (that is, their wickedneſſes, or evill things) <hi>were not plucked away (Jer.</hi> 6.29, 30.) They went into the Furnace full of droſſe, and they came out as full of droſſe as they went in. The Founder blowed his fire, till he burnt his bellows, but their luſts had no ſent of fire upon them; his lead (by which he ſeperates the droſſe from the metall) was all conſumed and evaporated, but the droſſe of their corruptions waſted no more then the pureſt gold doth in the fire. Hence the Lord reſolved to waſt no more of his judgements upon them: <hi>Why ſhould you be ſmitten any more, ye will revolt more and more (Iſa.</hi> 1.5.) To revolt from God, and to run upon him, are ſins of the ſame ſtraine; and they who revolt from him, will not feare to <hi>runne upon his necke, even upon the thicke Boſſes of his Buckler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> hath given us an account, why the Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts a wicked man all his dayes; he fights againſt God all his dayes. We have a reaſon of this reaſon in the next words; why it is that this wicked man is ſuch a valiant Champion againſt God, why he commits wickedneſſe with ſo much greedineſſe; it is, <hi>Becauſe he covers his face with his fatneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> The fatter and fuller he grows in fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh, the more hungry and ſharpe ſet he is to fulfill them.

He is active, yea full of activity in getting this cover, or mask of fatneſſe upon his face; and this mask diſcovers the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of his heart.</p>

                     <hi>That it is a ſigne of an evill heart, or a leane ſoule, to intend the fleſh, or to ſtudy the ſatisfying of the bodily appetite.</hi> A carnall man gives himſelfe to deliciouſneſſe; his greateſt labour is about that, for which Chriſt forbids our labour, <hi>The meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth (John</hi> 6.27.) This covering of our ſelves with fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and makings collops of fat, the Apoſtle reproves in thoſe, <hi>Whoſe God was their belly (Phil.</hi> 3.19.) and in thoſe <hi>who ſerved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their owne belly (Rom.</hi> 16.18.) They who ſerve their belly, as they ſhould ſerve God, make a god of it; and they who ſerve their belly at all doe not ſerve Chriſt at all. We may provide for the belly, but we muſt not ſerve it; and they who doe ſo, deſerve rather to be called Epicures then Chriſtians. That's ſinfull fatneſſe which is got upon termes of ſlavery, or ſervice to the belly: yea, a man that is intentive upon that queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I eate?</hi> and carefull how to feed his fleſh, though he doe not grow fat by it, yet he ſhewes himſelfe full of ſin by it. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of ſuch is for the fleſh, though their fleſh doe not thrive under that deſigne. As a man may be very covetous though he continue poor and leane in purſe; ſo a man may be very luxurious, and a great ſervant to Bacchus, and Belly-cheare, though he continue leane and poore in body.</p>
                  <p>The bleſſing of God fattens ſome, and ſuch fat ones bleſſe God. <hi>David</hi> Propheſies, that when <hi>The Kingdome ſhall be the Lords, and he the Governour among the Nations</hi> (which is very
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48478:78"/> paralell with what thoſe great voyces ſayd after the ſeventh Angel had ſounded (<hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15.) <hi>The Kingdomes of this World are become the Kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, and hee ſhall reigne for ever and ever;</hi> and when this ſhall be, ſaith <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 22.30.) <hi>Then all they that be fat upon the Earth, ſhall eate, and worſhip;</hi> that is, the great ones ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Chriſt; his Kingdome ſhall be inlarged, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the poore, who are deſcribed in the latter part of that Verſe in the Pſalme, under the name and notion of ſuch, <hi>as goe downe to the duſt,</hi> but the rich ſhall receive the Goſpell. Kings and Queens, perſons of Authority and wealth, ſhall come to the participation of the grace of Chriſt (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.3.10) They who have their bellyes full of the meat that periſheth, ſhall have their ſoules full of that meat which endures to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.12.) <hi>The rich among the people;</hi> What people? The firſt words of the Verſe tell us, he meanes the <hi>Tyrians</hi> who were a wonderfull rich people (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.) and the <hi>Tyrians</hi> are here put by a Synechdoche for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heathens; for though <hi>Tyre,</hi> were a City in the Tribe of <hi>Aſer (Joſh.</hi> 19.29.) yet it was at that time poſſeſſed by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Now, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The rich among theſe people ſhall intreat thy favour:</hi> That is, the Churches favour. God will work their hearts to an earneſt deſire of admiſſion into the ſociety of the Saints, and to live under a profeſſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, who have abounded in worldly poſſeſſions, and hold the World in ſubjection to their power: <hi>Theſe rich and fat ones among the people ſhall intreat thy favour.</hi> This Propheſie was in part fulfilled (<hi>Mark</hi> 3.8.) where we read of great multitudes from <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Chriſt: So that it is not riches and fatneſſe preciſely conſidered, but the intending of our skin, or our ſtudiouſneſſe to fill our ſelves with earthly delicates, which ſhewes we have weak appetites to, or rather a loathing of the things of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This covering the face with fat, is here preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Eliphaz</hi> as a cauſe or occaſion at leaſt of the wicked mans arming himſelfe againſt God.<note place="margin">Bonorum abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantia vitiorum omnium mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam ſubmini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat.</note>

                     <hi>That an evill heart turnes the bleſſings of God, into rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him:</hi> The Jewes were thus charged (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15.)
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48478:79"/> 
                     <hi>Jeſurun waxed fat, and kicked.</hi> The Lord complaines of this, as of a ſin, which he ſcarſe knew how to pardon (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7.) <hi>How ſhall I pardon thee for this? Thy Children have forſaken me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When I had fed them to the full, they then committed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and aſſembled themſelves by troops in the Harlots houſes.</hi> Thoſe are great ſins indeed, which put the Lord (whoſe title is, <hi>The God pardoning ſin,</hi> and <hi>ready to forgive</hi>) into a querie about their pardon and forgiveneſſe. Such kind of ſinning made <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> a Siſter to <hi>Sodom;</hi> that is, as like <hi>Sodom,</hi> yea and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> too, as if they had been one Mothers Daughters, or as if they had been of one and the ſelfe-ſame blood, and ſtock (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49.) <hi>Behold this was the iniquity of thy ſiſter Sodom, pride, fulneſſe of bread, and abundance of idleneſſe was in her, and in her Daughters:</hi> Plenty of the Creature, and plenty of ſin, went together, and whereas <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould have ſerved God, ſhee ſerved her luſts in the abundance of all things. We have a ſaying, when men are lifted up upon the enjoyment of outward good things (in alluſion to Beaſts) <hi>Provender pricks them.</hi> They act more like Beaſts then Men, who kick againſt God, who feeds them, and turne his bread of bleſſings into the ſtones of diſobedience. What outward good thing will not an evill heart abuſe, and wax wanton with, when it is ſo apt to abuſe ſpirituall things, and to turn <hi>the grace of God into laciviouſneſſe,</hi> that is, to grow wanton and lacivious, becauſe God is gracious?</p>

                     <hi>They take little care for their ſoules, who take over-much for their bodies:</hi> They who deſire to pleaſe appetite, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pleaſe God. When the Apoſtle exhorts to put on the Lord Jeſus, he dehorts from providing for the fleſh (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14.) <hi>Put yee on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof:</hi> As if he had ſayd, Unleſſe you forbeare providing for luſts, you will have little leaſure, and leſſe deſire to put on Chriſt. (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18.) <hi>Be not drunke with Wine wherein is exceſſe</hi> (that is, be not inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the uſe of the creature) <hi>but be filled with the ſpirit;</hi> as if he had ſayd, <hi>You will never be filled with the ſpirit, if over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled with Wine, if you give up your ſelves to ſatsifie carnall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, you wil not have any appetite at all to ſpirituals.</hi> There is an inward gluttony and drunkenneſſe, when the thoughts run
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48478:79"/> upon dainty Diſhes, and full Cups, or when men chew their meat and Wine in their thoughts, before they eate or drinke. Now as well they (or rather they more) who are inwardly drunken with exceſſive deſires of Wine, as they who are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly drunken with the exceſſive taking downe of Wine, are farr enough either from the deſire or attainement of a filling with the Spirit. The ſpirit of the Buttery, and the ſpirit of God have no more agreement then the fleſh and the ſpirit, yea that ſpirit is the groſſeſt part of ſinfull fleſh, and therefore can neither take care for, nor beare with, the things of the ſpirit. So farr of the firſt cauſe of the wicked mans exceſſive ſinning; his exceſſe in the uſe of the Creature, ſet forth by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect of it, <hi>Fatneſſe, He covereth his face with fatneſſe:</hi> The ſecond follows.</p>

But though to deſtroy and pull downe intimate ſtrength, yet to build and ſet up Cities requires grater ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>This ſtrength alſo is here aſcribed to the wicked man, who,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, either comes to Cities already overthrowne, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes Cities.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That God often makes the puniſhment of man ſuitable to his ſin: The Lord is known by the judgement which he executeth, the wicked is ſnared in the work of his owne hands (Pſal.</hi> 9.16.) The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are alwayes juſt, and ſometimes their juſtice is viſible. As the wicked feel them, ſo all may ſee them, and ſay, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord.</hi> The Prophet deſcribes this retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine judgement (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.8, 9.) <hi>Woe to them that add Houſe to Houſe, and lay Feild to Feild, till there be no place</hi> (that is, no place for others to dwell in) <hi>that they may be placed in the midſt of the earth:</hi> What is the danger of this? <hi>In mine eare ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts, of a truth, many Houſes ſhall be deſolate, many and faire without Inhabitant:</hi> Here is deſolation, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of deſolation; and as they took bread from others, and puld the cup from their mouthes, ſo their bread ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and their cup left empty. Thus it followes in the Prophet (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>Yea ten Akers of Vineyard ſhall yeeld one Bath:</hi> A Bath was a meaſure among the Jews, of Liquids, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, as is conceived, about eight Gallons; So that when he ſaith, <hi>Ten Akers of Vineyard ſhall yeild one Bath;</hi> the meaning is, there ſhall be a great ſcarcity of Wine: An Aker of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard ſhould not yeild a Gallon of Wine, that's a miſerable Vintage. <hi>And the ſeed of an Homer, ſhall yeild an Ephah;</hi> An Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48478:81"/> was a meaſure for dry things, containing ten Ephahs: So that when it is ſayd, <hi>The ſeed of a Homer ſhall yeeld an Ephah,</hi> the meaning is, they ſhall reape but the tenth part of the ſeed ſowne, which is a miſerable Harveſt, and the higheſt threat of enſuing Famine. Thus the Lord puniſhed them as they had ſinned; they ſtarved the poore, and God threatens to ſtarve them. Hunger never pinches ſo terribly as when it is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent at the cry of the hungry.</p>
                  <p>Againe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.1.) <hi>When thou ſhalt ceaſe to deal treacherouſly then they ſhall deale treacherouſly with thee:</hi> When the deceiver is deceived, and the trecherous dealer ruined by treacherous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling men, then the truth and faithfulneſſe of God are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently exalted. And as it is in puniſhments, ſo often in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, God doth us good in the ſame way wherein we have done good. The Midwives ſaved the Males of the Iſraelites in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and by this act of pitty built the houſe of Iſrael, which the Lord took ſo well at their hands, <hi>That he built their houſes, or made their houſes flouriſh (Ez.</hi> 1.21.) As the deſtroyer ſhall be deſtroyed, ſo the builder ſhall be built; mercy loves to be exact as well as judgement.</p>
                  <p>Againe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> tells us of Cities and Houſes, ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heapes.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt flouriſhing Cities, the ſtrongeſt ſtructures in the World, are ſubject to ruine:</hi> Art cannot prevent the decayes of nature, much leſſe the decrees of divine Juſtice. Materiall Jeruſalem was threatned, that one ſtone ſhould not be left upon another, which ſhould not be caſt downe; the event anſwered that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.

                  <p>The words ſeeme to carry an oppoſition all along to the wicked mans purpoſes and projects. The wicked man ſaith in his heart, if not with his mouth, <hi>He will be rich;</hi> to which God anſwers, <hi>He ſhall not be rich.</hi> The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.) ſpeakes of ſuch a ſort of <hi>Rich Will-bees, They that will be rich fall into temptation, &amp;c.</hi> When a man comes to this hight of reſolvedneſſe, He will be rich what ever comes of it, or who-ever ſtands in his way, he will be rich and aske no mans leave, no nor Gods leave, then God riſes to his high reſolves, <hi>Hee ſhall not be rich:</hi> Let it come to tryall whoſe word ſhall ſtand, his, or mine: And when once this word is gone out of Gods mouth, then he, and all his trees which ſhould beare him that golden fruit, are blaſted and mildew'd. Then, though he lay the ſtrongeſt projects for riches, yet he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48478:82"/> ſhall not be rich, though he ſweat and toyle to be rich, though he digg deep into the ground, and turne every ſtone above ground, to finde riches, yet he ſhall not be rich; though he cares not whom he makes poore, yea though himſelfe live poorly all his dayes, that he may dye rich, yet he ſhall not be rich.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is not in the power of man to get riches:</hi> A man may make it his deſigne to be rich, but he cannot make himſelfe rich. <hi>Moſes (Deut.</hi> 8.18.) gives it in charge to the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>Thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, &amp;c.</hi> Man is very apt to forget the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, not onely of his ſpirituall, but of his temporall good things, and is readier to aſcribe his riches to his owne get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, then to Gods giving. Temporall good things lye more levell to the power of nature and humane induſtry, then ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualls, yet we can no more attaine temporalls then ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls without the power of God. Chriſt teacheth us, that our care can no more add a penny to our eſtate, then <hi>a cubit to our ſtature (Matth.</hi> 6.27.) How often have we ſeen experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſealing to this truth? Many have endeavoured after, and reacht at riches, in good and hopefull, in faire and probable wayes, yet they have not reacht to riches. Others have ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for riches in baſe and unwarrantable, in unjuſt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wayes, yet they could never get a ſtep beyond beggery.</p>
                  <p>The Lord gives them a ſtop, and ſaith, <hi>Yee ſhall not be rich;</hi> evill men doe not alwayes thrive,<note place="margin">Ex quocunque piſcatu non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadet ditior.</note> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> fiſhed all night, but got nothing, till Chriſt bid him put downe the Net. Some have caſt their Net in all ſorts of waters, yet could never catch the great fiſh of worldly wealth. It is the bleſſing of God that makes good men rich; and it is a permiſſion from God that makes evill men rich. Godlineſſe is profitable for all things, having the promiſe of this life, and of that which is to come, yet every godly man meets not with the profit of this life; ungodlineſſe is profitable for nothing, having neither the promiſe of this life nor of that which is to come, yet ſome ungodly men meet with the profit of this life. Though <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are never on the thriving hand, yet they often thrive in their way;</hi> and though Saints are ever on the thriving ſide, yet they doe not alwayes thrive in their way: Neither the one
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48478:82"/> ſort nor the other thrives, if the Lord ſaith, <hi>They ſhall not be rich:</hi> When he ſaith ſo to the Saints, it is to humble them; but when he ſaith ſo to a wicked man, it is to puniſh him; He ſhall not be rich, that's the firſt ſtep of his miſery.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe he get riches, yet he cannot keep them; <hi>The wages which he earnes is put into a bagg with holes, or pierced through, all's gone (Hag.</hi> 1.6.) Carnall men are like leaking Veſſells to the Word of God, they (as the Apoſtle cautions Beleevers leſt at any time they ſhould (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1.) alwayes let it run out. Now as they let out what they have heard of the Word of God, ſo God lets out what they have got of the World: He makes all the Veſſells which hold their earthly ſubſtance leaky: So it follows.</p>

                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the moſt ſubſtantiall of earthly things are of ſmall or no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance:</hi> More particularly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ill gotten goods are not laſting, or long-lived:</hi> Sometimes they melt away, and dye in the ſame hands that got them; they alwayes dye and melt away in ſome of their hands, for whom they were gotten. There is no tack in their eſtate, in whom there is no Juſtice. That which is gathered by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe of man, ſhall be ſcattered by the wrath of God.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48478:83"/> at all for the ſoule, and it makes very ill-proviſion for the body. The title by which we hold worldly things, is more conſiderable then worldly things themſelves.

Now as a wicked man would compleat his ſin, and often reaches the very perfection of it, ſo he would compleat his eſtate, and doth ſometimes reach to the perfection of it. The wicked man would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly rich, he is not ſatisfied to have a compleat eſtate, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for meat, drink, and cloathing, he muſt have a great eſtate, enough for pride, pompe, and glory; Manna pleaſes him not, he muſt have Quailes, ſuperfluities as well as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: He thinkes a little, too much in ſpiritualls, but a great deale is not enough for him in temporals: His internall imperfections trouble him not, his aime is at perfection in externalls. That is perfect onely in a ſtrict ſenſe, to which nothing can be added, and from which nothing can be taken
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48478:83"/> away; The wicked man would attaine to ſuch perfection, but he cannot; his owne heart forbids the firſt, for how much ſoever he hath, he would have more added to it; he ſaith not it is enough, though it be too much; God forbids the latter, his portion ſhall be abated, or (in the words of the Text) <hi>He ſhall not prolong the perfection thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The utmoſt perfection he can attaine unto, is but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of perfection, and though ſhadows towards the ſetting of the Sun, grow longer and longer, yet no ſhadow can be prolonged, they quickly paſſe and flye away. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us (<hi>Prov.</hi> 12.3.) <hi>A man ſhall not be eſtabliſhed in wickedneſſe,</hi>

                     <hi>but the root of the righteous ſhall continue:</hi> A wicked man may be ſet in the ground, but he hath no root in the ground; <hi>Their ſtock ſhall not take root in the earth, and he</hi> (that is, God) <hi>ſhall blow upon them, and they ſhall wither (Iſa.</hi> 40.24.) A tree not rooted, falls by a puffe of winde, or withers while it ſtands. The tree of a wicked man may have a great body, but he hath no good root, he is not rooted in Chriſt, he hath no hold of the Covenant, therefore his perfection cannot continue.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That as there is no worldly perfection of any long continuance, ſo the perfection of wicked men is of ſhorteſt continuance: Athenaſius</hi> ſayd of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, when he was in the height, in the very zenith and perfection of earthly felicity, having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the Impereall Throne, and giving the Law to a great part of the then knowne World, <hi>He is but a little cloud,</hi>

                  <p>

                     <hi>Wicked men falling into trouble, ſhall not know the mercy of a reſurrection out of trouble. The juſt man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth againe (Prov.</hi> 24.16.) The juſt man is ſubject to take falls of two ſorts, and both of them <hi>Seven times;</hi> that is, often.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He falls into ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He falls into trouble.</p>
                  <p>He riſeth from both theſe falls: He riſeth from the firſt by repentance; he riſeth from the ſecond by deliverance. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Text is to be underſtood of this ſecond ſort of falls, and may therefore be expounded by the direct words of <hi>David, (Pſal.</hi> 34.19.) <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all:</hi> The righteous have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſurrections as falls, <hi>But</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> makes the Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis in the place fore-cited) <hi>the wicked ſhall fall into miſchiefe. Solomon</hi> doth not tell us expreſſely, what the juſt mans fals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but he tells us he ſhall riſe againe: He tells us expreſſely what the wicked man ſhall fall into, but he doth not tell us, that he ſhall riſe againe; nay, he tells us implicitely, that he ſhall never riſe againe. He that riſeth againe, did not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miſchiefe, how great ſoever the evill was which he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and he that doth not riſe againe, fell into miſchiefe, how little ſoever the evill was which he fell into. Nothing makes our falling either into ſin, or trouble, <hi>a miſchiefe to us,</hi> but our continuing in it. <hi>He goes farr</hi> (we ſay in our Proverbe) <hi>who never returnes;</hi> ſurely, he fals low, who never riſeth, and he ſtayes long in darkneſſe, who never departs out of it.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48478:85"/> nor miſery; he hath no deſire to depart out of the former, and he hath no promiſe to depart out of the latter. Thus we have ſeen the negative puniſhment of a wicked man, what he ſhall not be, what he ſhall not receive; this is enough to make him miſerable, but poſitive evill will make him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right miſerable.

The Prophet complaines (<hi>Joel</hi> 1.19.) <hi>O Lord to thee will I cry, for the fire hath devoured the paſtures of the Wilderneſſe, and the flame hath burnt all the Trees of the Field:</hi> The flame, of which he cryes out, and which did not onely dry the branches, but devour the Trees of the Feild, was the extreame heat of the Sun; which as it uſually ſends out refreſhing beams, ſo when God is angry, it can ſend out ſcorching flames, and thoſe beames, which tempered with ſhowers of raine, nouriſh the Earth, in the long withholding of raine ſcorch the Earth. And what then befell the Trees properly taken, and their
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48478:85"/> branches, doth often befall both Trees and branches taken in the metaphoricall ſenſe, as herein the Text, a flame dryes them up. A godly man is compared to a Tree flouriſhing and <hi>growing by the water ſide;</hi> wicked men are compared ſomtimes to flouriſhing Trees, but they grow <hi>by the fire ſide: The flame dryes up their branches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The wrath of God is a drying, yea a devouring flame, the flame of Gods diſpleaſure, puts all into a flame.</hi> That flame will burn up branches, how goodly, how ſtrong, how high ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are growne; though as ſtrong as the Oakes of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan,</hi> though as high as the Cedars in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> yet this flame will dry them up. The Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeaks this point, while he thus beſpeaks <hi>Lebanon</hi> (<hi>Zech.</hi> 11.1.) <hi>Open thy doores O Lebanon, that the fire may devoure thy Cedars:</hi> 'Tis interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a Propheſie of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> by the Roman power; as Chriſt after threatned them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting him and his Counſell: The words of the Prophet may be underſtood two wayes, either litterally, for the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Forreſt of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which the Romans cut down for the ſervice of their Seige againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> or figuratively, for the flouriſhing eſtate of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe branches, though like the branches of the Cedars in <hi>Lebanon</hi> were dryed up by the flame of that dreadfull War. In which ſtile and figure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> denounceth the judgements of God (<hi>Ch.</hi> 2.12, 13.) <hi>The day of the Lord ſhall be upon every one that is proud and lofty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And upon all the Cedars of Lebanon.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> puts forth this Riddle and Parable (<hi>Chap.</hi> 17.3.) Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>A great Eagle</hi> (that is, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon) with great wings, long winged, full of feathers, which had diverſe colours, came unto Lebanon</hi> (that is, unto <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem) and tooke che higheſt branch of the Cedar;</hi> Namely, <hi>Jehojakim</hi> the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and carryed him Captive to <hi>Babylon.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord can make any affliction a conſumption to the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull branches of a ſinfull people, or perſon:</hi> Whatſoever he uſeth as an inſtrument of his indignation, is his flame: In this ſenſe, the very waters which drowned the old World, were the fire and flame of God: He can by poverty, as by a flame, conſume and dry up riches; by diſgrace, as by a flame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and dry up honour; by ſickneſſe, as by a flame, conſume
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48478:86"/> and dry up health; God hath ſpeciall flames for every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall branch, nothing can continue to doe us good, when God gives Warrant or Commiſſion to any of his flames to ſcorch and conſume it, <hi>The flame ſhall burne up his branch.</hi>

                  <q>And by the breath of his mouth ſhall he goe away.</q>
                  <p>We have the flame of God in the former clauſe, and the breath of his mouth in this: Some Interpreters conceive that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> mentions theſe two, The flame, and the breath, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeſy to put <hi>Job</hi> in minde, what God had done to him; for we read in the firſt Chapter of this Book, of the flame of God, a fire from Heaven conſuming that branch, his flocks of Sheep, and <hi>a breath from God,</hi> namely, a mighty ſtrong winde, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying a more precious branch, his flock of Children: <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> cloathes this diſcourſe in ſuch termes as might eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minde and repreſent to <hi>Job,</hi> what God had done to him, in the day of his calamity.</p>
                  <q>And by the breath of his mouth ſhall he goe away.</q>
                  <p>There is yet a difference among Expoſitors about the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to <hi>his: His mouth,</hi> whoſe mouth? Moſt underſtand it, of the breath of Gods mouth, as hath been hinted already: Some expound it of the breath of the wicked mans owne mouth; I ſhall touch upon both.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>By the breath of Gods mouth he ſhall goe away;</hi> the breath of God may be taken two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Either firſt (as the flame before) for his anger, which is often expreſſed by puffing the breath.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may be taken for the decree, or determination of God.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe wayes a wicked man goes away by the breath of God; firſt, by the anger of God, if God doe but breath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly upon him, he is blaſted and gone, <hi>His glory and greatneſſe lang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48478:86"/> thoſe, who neglected to build the Houſe of the Lord (<hi>Hag.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>Yee looked for much, but loe it came to little, and when yee brought it home, I did blow upon it:</hi> God did but blow upon it, and by the breath of his mouth all their expected encreaſe went away. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſued the Iſraelites in the height of pride and preſumption, the Text ſaith, <hi>It came to paſſe in the morning watch, the Lord looked upon the Hoaſt of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, and troubled the Egyptians, and tooke off their Chariot wheeles, that they drave them heavily (Exod.</hi> 14.24, 25.) God confounded them <hi>by a looke;</hi> how eaſily can the Lord riſe up and deſtroy all the power that riſeth up againſt his people? Hee can doe it with a breath from his mouth, With a caſt of his eye. When Chriſt was apprehended by the Officers armed with Staves and Swords; he ſayd, <hi>Whom ſeek you?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>Jeſus of Nazereth:</hi> He ſaith, <hi>I am he.</hi> (Chriſt was not afraid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe himſelfe) <hi>As ſoon then as he had ſayd unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground (Joh</hi> 18.6.) What a ſtrange power was here, that Chriſt could caſt them down with a word, and that not an angry word, not a word of conviction but confeſſion; he did not chide them, and ſay, Yee wretches, how dare you lay your hands upon me, who am an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; how dare you carry me to judgement, who ſhall one day be your Judge; Chriſt ſpake no ſuch terrible language, but onely ſayd, <hi>I am he,</hi> and downe they fell. If theſe words of ſubmiſſion had ſuch a force in them, as overthrew thoſe Officers to the ground, how ſhall his Enemies ſtand before the thunder of his ſevereſt increpations, and finall ſentence? As the Lord needs not make great proviſions for comforting of his people, if he ſpeaks a word, it is done; if he give but a good look, their hearts revive; <hi>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon me, thou haſt put gladneſſe in my heart (Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7.) So if God doe but darken his countenance againſt wicked men, and frowne upon them, if he doe but breath at them, he puts ſorrow enough into their hearts, even conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming killing ſorrow; <hi>By the breath of his mouth they goe away.</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48478:87"/> 7, 8, 9.) That is, he hath given out his word from Heaven, the habitation of his holineſſe, and of his glory; or, He hath ſpoken it certainely, there is nothing but holineſſe in his word (and that's the ſtrength of words) <hi>David</hi> having received this word, ſtands aſſured, That as <hi>Shechem,</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth, Gilead,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh, Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit to him, and yeild obedience: So alſo, that <hi>Moab, Edom,</hi> and <hi>Philiſtia,</hi> who were his profeſſed Enemies, ſhould be ſubdued to him. He expected to conquer and tryumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, to put them to the baſeſt offices, as his Vaſſals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had decreed and ſpoken it in his holineſſe. God hath ſpoken the word (ſaith he) therefore it ſhall be done, yea 'tis done; and therefore <hi>David</hi> cryed, <hi>All's mine, Gilead is mine, Manaſſeh is mine, Moab and Edom are mine,</hi> as ſoone as God had ſpoken the word. All that ever was done in the World, hath been done by the breath of Gods mouth; that is, by the word or decree of God: So ſome underſtand that of the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>And then ſhall that wicked one be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit, or breath of his mouth, and deſtroy with the brightneſſe of his comming:</hi> Antichriſt hath ſtood long, and he hath been for ſome time declining; his downfall haſtens; the breath of God will leave him breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: As he hath ſtood by the flattering breath of men; ſo he ſhall fall by the conſuming breath of God.</p>
                  <p>This conſuming with breath, notes either (as before) the eaſineſſe of that conſumption, 'tis done with a breath, or the way and manner of doing it; 'tis done by the command and decree of God, or by the Preaching of the Goſpell, which indeed gives Antichriſt his fatall blow, and ſhakes all the Towres of myſticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> and is called by the Prophet, The rod of his mouth,<note place="margin">Spiritu oris, ſc: ipſius impii, credo potius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrendum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſſe ad impium quaſi ille ſibi ipſi fuerit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis cauſa dum contra Deum loquitur confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denter &amp; libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <hi>Sanct.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Further, The breath of his mouth, ſay ſome, is the breath of the wicked mans owne mouth; <hi>By the breath of his mouth ſhall he goe away:</hi> That is, by the words which breath out of his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48478:87"/> mouth. His paſſionate diſtempered ſpeeches ſhall undoe him, while he ſpeaks, either outragiouſly, and blaſphemouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, or falſely and ſeditiouſly towards man, his ruine enters at the opening of his lips.</p>
                  <p>The motion of the breath is the preſerver of life,<note place="margin">Spiritu oris ſui. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuis verbis quae ſpiritu &amp; halitu in ore ormantur.</note> and while breath laſts, life laſts; yet many a mans life had laſted longer had it not been for his breath. The wicked mans breath proves his death, and his tongue which hath been a ſcourge to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becomes a Sword to himſelfe. His words poſſibly have wounded, and his breath hath been the death of many: But now he is wounded by his owne words, and cruſht to death by the weight of his owne breath, or by the fall of his owne tongue upon him: So the Pſalmiſt gives it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.8.) <hi>They ſhall make their owne tongues to fall upon themſelves;</hi> that is, Their owne words ſhall be brought as a Teſtimony againſt them, and condemne them. <hi>The tongue is a little member</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, Chap.</hi> 3.5.) and therefore a light member; <hi>yet it falls heavy, as heavy as lead.</hi> A man were better have his Houſe fall upon him, then that (in this ſenſe) his tongue ſhould fall upon him. Some have been preſſed to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not ſpeak, but ſtood mute before the Judge; but more have been preſſed to death by their ſinfull freedome, or rather licentiouſneſſe in ſpeaking; this hath brought them to judgement, and caſt them in judgement: <hi>Their tongue hath fallen upon them, and by the breath of their mouth, they have gone away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly (but I will not ſtay upon it, becauſe the Originall doth not well beare it) theſe words are caſt into the forme of a ſimilitude, deſcribing the manner how the wicked man, and all his glory ſhall goe away; even as a breath, or as his breath; <hi>As the breath of his mouth he ſhall goe away;</hi> that is, he ſhall go ſpeedily, he ſhall goe ſuddenly: A breath is ſoon fetcht, it is both come and gone in a moment; <hi>A breathing time,</hi> is a Proverbiall, <hi>for a little time</hi> (much like that, <hi>In the twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye.</hi>) Thus man comes and goes, is come and gone (eſpecially a wicked man who is driven by the wrath of God) as ſoon as ſeen by others, as ſoon as he hath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed himſelfe: It will not be long ere he goes, and he will not be long a going. <hi>For as the breath of his mouth he ſhall goe away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:48478:88"/>
                  <p>The breath of man goes continually, and ſo doth the life of man; while man ſleeps, his breath goes, and ſo doth his life; while man ſtands ſtill, his breath goes, and ſo doth his life: The breath, indeed, is ſometimes in a hurry, and goes faſter then it doth at other times; but though the life of man doth not goe faſter at one time then at another, yet it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes goes.</p>
                  <p>Or if at any time our life may be ſayd to goe faſter then at another, it is when our breath is (by ſome ſtop in its paſſage) at a ſtand; and when ever our breath comes to a full ſtop, our life is not onely going, but quite gone.</p>
                  <p>The life of man hath ſo much dependence upon his breath, that it is called <hi>Breath,</hi> and <hi>the breath of life: When God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med man out of the duſt of the ground, he breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, and man became a living ſoule (Gen.</hi> 2.7.) And as ſoon as God calls back this breath of life, man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a dead body, or a carkaſſe: The life of man muſt needs goe as his breath, for it goes with his breath; and when the life of a wicked man is gone, all (that he called his) his worldly glory, goes with him: In that day all his thoughts periſh: For, <hi>As the breath of his mouth he ſhall goe away.</hi>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Man is very apt to be deceived; ſo apt to be deceived, that he is ſcarſe ever undeceived: Eliphaz</hi> ſpeakes here, not onely of a poſſibility to be deceived, but of being actually deceived; and this ariſeth two waies, firſt from the impotence and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, from the blindneſſe and ignorance that is in man; he that is blinde and weake, is eaſily miſlead; every man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, how ſtrong, how wiſe, how knowing ſoever he ſeems to be, is yet weak, blind, and ignorant in a very great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and therefore very deceivable: Man is full of craft, this makes him deceitfull; he is empty of true wiſedome, this renders him deceiveable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As man may quickly be deceived, by reaſon of the ignorance which is in him, ſo alſo by reaſon of thoſe ſubtle enemies, who are alwayes about him, yea and within him. We live (as I may ſo ſpeake) among Cheaters, and Cozenners, and there is a great Cheater lives in us; how hard is it then not to be deceived? If a man be in a Croud among many Cut-purſes, and Cheaters, he is in danger to loſe his Money every moment; it is ſo with us: though carnall men are not at all aware of it, nor they who are moſt ſpirituall, ſo much aware of it as they ſhould It is dangerous to live among deceivers, though we know them, and are aware of them; it is moſt dangerous to live among deceivers, and not to know them, for then we cannot be aware of them; but it is madneſſe to know we live among deceivers, and yet not to be aware of them.</p>
                  <p>There are three notorious Deceivers, who labour to enſnare us; we need not wonder though ſome who are watchful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, are deceived by them: but it would be a wonder, and ſuch a wonder as yet was never ſeen, if they ſhould not be deceived, who never watch againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Our owne hearts which have not onely an impotence
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48478:90"/> or weakneſſe (as I noted before) whereby they are apt to be deceived, but there is in our hearts an activeneſſe, yea an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to deceive; we are not onely paſſive, but active; we are ſeldome, if at all, deceived, till wee deceive our ſelves: And as ſome men are very active in deceiving others, ſo all men are active in a degree to deceive themſelves. (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9.) <hi>The heart of man is deceitfull and deſperately wicked:</hi> The heart is deceitfull in reference to a threefold object.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The heart would deceive God himſelfe, and impoſe upon the <hi>All-wiſe:</hi> Thats the deſigne of a Hypocrite, his buſineſſe is to deceive God, though the iſſue be the deceiving of himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The heart of man is deceitfull in contriving wayes to deceive, and ſupplant other men. The complaint of the Prophet goes very high upon this (<hi>Mich.</hi> 7.2.) <hi>The good man is periſhed out of the Earth, and there is none upright among men; they all lye in waite for blood; they hunt every man his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a net.</hi> To <hi>lye in waite,</hi> is the act, and <hi>a Net</hi> is the inſtrument of a Deceiver, The Propheſie of Chriſt goes yet higher (<hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24.) <hi>For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders; inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very Elect.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit workes to its utmoſt poſſibility, when it puts hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe, whom to deceive is impoſſible. If Elect men could be deceived, God ſhould be deceived in his Election; But this is impoſſible, and therefore that is; the man who is elect is deceiveable, but becauſe he is an elect man, he cannot be deceived: And though an elect man may be deceived in ſome things (for even he is ſubject to errour, becauſe he is ſtill (while in this World) the ſubject of ſin) yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo farr deceived in any thing, as to null or fruſtrate his election. How reſtleſſe is man to deceive man, ſeeing he ceaſeth not his endeavour to deceive, where he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailingly deceive.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (Which I conceive the Text in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpecially aymes at) the heart of man is very buſie to deceive himſelfe. 'Tis bad enough to deceive others, but to deceive our ſelves is worſe, and that not onely becauſe it makes us more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but more ſinfull: Selfe-deceit is the moſt ſinfull deceit. The heart of man is <hi>deſperately wicked,</hi> there is no hope that,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48478:91"/> it will leave off to doe wickedly, ſeeing it is of counſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its owne peace. And ſurely, man is not onely under a poſſibility to be deceived, in regard of the impotence and blindneſſe of his heart, but alſo under an impoſſibility, not to be deceived, in regard of the skill and unwearyed activity of his heart to deceive himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Man hath another deceiver continually about him, <hi>The World,</hi> and all that is in the World, <hi>The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life;</hi> all theſe are but as ſo many ſnares and juggels to cozen, and deceive poore man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Devill, who is <hi>The Deceiver;</hi> of whoſe <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices we are not ignorant</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) he is full of tricks and plots; he hath his methods, his arts to deceive. Ever ſince the Devill deceived himſelfe, he hath been ſtudying how to deceive man; he doth not onely goe about like a roaring Lyon, but like a ſubtle Serpent, and a cunning Fox, ſeeking whom he may devour; or he is a Lyon to devour thoſe whom he hath firſt deceived as a Fox, or as a Serpent: <hi>Man is a perſwadable creature (Gen.</hi> 9.27.) <hi>God ſhall perſwade Japhet to dwell in the Tents of Shem:</hi> The Originall word there uſed to <hi>perſwade,</hi> ſignifies alſo to deceive, becauſe perſwaſions are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made as Engines, or baytes to deceive.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a kind of holy fraud in the Goſpell, and man is as it were deceived into the obedience of it, <hi>Being craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I caught you with guile</hi> (I fetcht you over, did I not?) ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16.) Now as man is ſomtimes deceived for his good, ſo he is often and eaſily deceived for his hurt, by theſe three deceivers. Satan, the World, and his owne Heart, perſwade him by an unholy deceit to dwell in the Tents of ſin.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13.) chargeth ſin with deceit to its very face, <hi>Exhort one the other, while it is called to day, leaſt any of your hearts be hardned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin;</hi> there are three eminent evils in ſin,</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:48478:91"/>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a pollution in ſin, it defiles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is baſeneſſe in ſin, it diſhonours.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a deceitfulneſſe in ſin, it would make us beleeve we ſhall be, and receive, that which it is not able to performe.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.) puts the queſtion to thoſe who were once the ſervants of ſin, <hi>What fruit had yee then in thoſe things whereof you are now aſhamed?</hi> He asketh them, and bids them aske their owne hearts, what fruit had you? as if he had ſayd, <hi>I know when you were ſervants of ſin, your ſins promiſed you great matters, great rewards: the Tree of ſin ſeemes to be loaded with fruits, the bowes of it looke as if ready to break with goodly fruits; fruit pleaſant to the eye, ſweet to the taſte, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable to make one wiſe; but I beſeech yon tell me what fruit had you in thoſe things wh reof you are now aſhamed?</hi> If you be aſhamed to tell me; I will tell you, <hi>The end of thoſe things is death;</hi> that's all the fruit which the Tree of ſin beares. Sin deales with us, as <hi>Jaell</hi> with <hi>Siſera (Judges</hi> 4.18.) Shee ſtood at the Tent doore, when he came panting from the Battell, and ſaid to him, <hi>Turne in my Lord, turne in;</hi> ſhee took him into her Tent, and layd him downe, covered him warme, and when he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her for Milke, ſhee gave him Butter, Butter in a Lordly diſh; here were fine words, and ſeeming promiſes: yet ſhee honeſtly deceived him, <hi>Shee put her hand to the Naile, and her hand to the workmans Hammer, and nayled his temples to the ground.</hi> Thus ſin bids us turn in, promiſes to cover us warme, gives us Butter in a Lordly diſh, but never tells us of that wofull end, and wretched cataſtrophe which it intends unto us: Sinne deales with us as <hi>Dallilah</hi> with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> takes us into its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and embraces; but then it hath a plot to cut the lock of our ſtrength, to deliver us over to the Philiſtims, to call in Legions of Devills to ſeize upon us, and make us grinde at the Mill of their baſeſt drudgery.</p>
                  <p>More diſtinctly, ſin deceives by a threefold promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By a promiſe of profit (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.13.) <hi>Come caſt in thy lot with us, let us lye in waite for blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We ſhall find all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſubſtance, we ſhall fill our houſes with ſpoyle:</hi> but this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſubſtance, proves onely a pernicious ſhadow, and theſe ſpoiles taken, ſpoyle thoſe who take them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sin deceives by promiſing content, and ſweet
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48478:92"/> delight; what thoughts had <hi>Ahab</hi> concerning <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard? If he could but get it, he were <hi>a made man;</hi> what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhould he have in thoſe ſhady walkes? what Grapes and Wine from thoſe fruitfull Vines? Sin promiſeth as largely as God doth, to give us not onely delight but ſatisfaction; that we ſhall not have ſo much as an empty corner in our ſoules; all ſhall be filled: whereas in truth there is nothing but emptineſſe, and diſſatisfaction in any creature, eſpecially when ſin leads or helps us to the enjoyment of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, At leaſt, ſin promiſeth and gives its word for it, that we ſhall be free from trouble, and feele no evill; <hi>That we ſhall have peace, though we walke in the imagination of our heart (Deut.</hi> 29.19.) That as they flattered themſelves in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>wee ſhall not ſee Sword, nor Famine:</hi> Theſe vaniſhing dreames of plenty, of good things, and immunity from evill, carry thouſands of ſoules captive to the baſeſt bondage of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Further, This vanity, from truſting which the deceived ſoule is called off by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> is conceived to be worldly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the fulleſt poſſeſſion of the creature; theſe are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: That they are, is <hi>a common theame,</hi> and yet though it be much ſpoken of, it is very little beleived; we are apt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rate the things of the World, and under-rate the things of Heaven. The creature is vanity, not onely in regard of the nothingneſſe of it, but vanity in regard of that which we call the ſomthingneſſe of it, or the beſt of it.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> makes the word which we here tranſlate vanity,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Vanitates mendacii ſive mendaces.</note> the Epethite of that which is commonly tranſlated va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (<hi>Jon.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>They that obſerve lying vanities:</hi> Idolls are vanity, and a lye, becauſe though they can doe no good at all, yet they promiſe much: Riches are vanity, and a lye, becauſe they cannot doe ſo much good as they promiſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, That Money anſwereth all things (Chap.</hi> 8.10.) And ſo it doth as the value of all earthly things is made by Money, and as Money is the price of all earthly things. But though Money anſwereth all things, by ſatisfying our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, yet it anſwereth nothing to the ſatisfying of its owne engagements. Money and riches have payd many a mans debts, and enough of them will pay any mans debts; but they have never payd their owne debts, no more then
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48478:92"/> Idols have, and therefore they juſtly beare the brand of this reproach, <hi>Lying vanities:</hi> That they are ſo, appeares clearely in two particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the report which they make of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the promiſes which they make to us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the report which they make of their owne worth; if you look upon the bil of the creature, it puts down, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a hundred for fifty, but a million for a mite: For, how much ſoever it is worth, yet it beares no proportion to that which it would be eſteemed worth: As ſome rich men are not halfe ſo rich as they deſire to be reckoned; ſo riches themſelves are not ſo rich by thouſands of thouſands as they would be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned.</p>
                  <p>There is indeed a created worth in the creature, for it is the work of God; but ſince the ſin of man hath (as to us) both imbaſed, and imbittered the creature, it is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparatively to that at which it is rated, both in its owne, and our Books.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The creature (in this notion) is a lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, while it perſwades us; that in the enjoyment thereof we ſhall be happy; whereas our happineſſe doth not conſiſt in any creature-enjoyment; unleſſe God himſelfe be our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are both poor and miſerable in the fulleſt poſſeſſion of the creature. God is the <hi>living ſtreame,</hi> the creature at the beſt was but a Ciſterne, and now it is but a broken Ciſterne which leaks out all the waters that paſſe into it, unleſſe God ſtop the chinks, and mend the cracks of it, by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, The creature promiſeth to eaſe us of our cares, yet it doth but multiply them: The creature promiſeth to ſatisfie our deſires, yet it doth only encreaſe and enrage them. Riches are not food, but fewell to our deſires; they doe not allay our appetite, as bread doth, when received into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, but enflame our appetite, as wood doth, when it is caſt into the fire.</p>
                  <p>Further, The creature promiſeth to protect us; hence that of <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 10.15.) <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong Citie:</hi> That is, it promiſeth to be ſo, and tells him, it will doe that for him, which a ſtrong City doth for its Inhabitants, defend him againſt all Commers and Invaders; yet the ſame <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſures us in the next Chapter (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 4.) <hi>That riches
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48478:93"/> profit not in the day of wrath.</hi> And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> threatens the Jews, That <hi>their Silver and their Gold ſhall not deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Creature promiſeth to continue with us. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches tell us, that though Father and Mother forſake us, yet they will not, though Wife and Children forſake us, yet they will not; they make us beleeve that they will ſtick cloſer to us, then Chriſt himſelfe, and yet they are upon the wing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, they flye away as the Eagle, and are gone out of ſight, they doe not onely periſh in the uſing, but periſh from our uſe.</p>
                  <p>Is not all this and a thouſand times more, which might be ſayd of their lying, and vanity, enough, and more then enough to juſtifie thoſe titles which the Spirit of God hath beſtowed upon them, that they are vanity and a lye, or as <hi>Jonah</hi> calls them, <hi>Lying vanities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet (to cloſe the point) we muſt remember that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-riches are not a lye, nor deceitfull in themſelves.

Man is a weak creature, ſenſe and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are enough to make him ſenſible of his naturall weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and theſe alſo are enough to prompt and provoke him to ſeek helpe without himſelfe, though they are utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to direct him whither to goe for the ſureſt helpe; <hi>It is the priviledge of God alone to have nothing to truſt to, or to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

It is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of that worſhip which we owe to God, to truſt him; and whatſoever we truſt beſides God, we make a God of it.

                     <hi>Man is apt to truſt that which hath deceived him; or man being once deceived, truſts that which will deceive him againe. Let not him that is deceived truſt in vanity:</hi> We ſay, <hi>Such a man hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me once, but he ſhall not deceive me the ſecond time:</hi> But carnall hearts being deceived once by ſin and vanity, are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be deceived a thouſand times; being once deceived, they care not how often they are deceived: That of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is an eminent Teſtimony to this too much experimented truth (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20.) <hi>He feedeth on aſhes;</hi> that is, he is as much deluded as a man is, who eates aſhes, thinking it to be bread or other good cheare; or his Idoll which promiſed him great

                  <p>God never deceived, no nor fayled any man that truſted in him (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 9.10.) yet the hearts of the moſt will not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to truſt God; ſin and the creature deceive all that truſt in them, yet we can hardly call or beat the heart off from truſting them. Sin ſeldome looſes its credit; ſin hath broken and undone thouſands, yea all who have truſted it; yet ſtill it hath credit among thouſands, and can be truſted with more then this World is worth, the precious ſoule of man, for the asking.

So <hi>every diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Law received a juſt recompence of reward (Heb.</hi> 2.2.) And God is ſo exact in giving the recompences of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, that he will not ſpare his owne, when they are ſo fooliſh as to truſt in vanity (<hi>Prov.</hi> 11.31.) <hi>Behold the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall be recompenced in the earth, much more the wicked and the ſinner:</hi> that is, A righteous man ſhall be corrected, though he ſin of infirmity; how then ſhall the wicked be puniſhed who ſin with preſumption and delight.

But, we may ſtrongly argue, that the wicked, who truſt in vanity ſhall be recompenced with ſorrow for ever; ſeeing the righteous, if they doe but a little turne aſide to vanity, ſhall be recompenced with ſorrow here: That's the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> way of reaſoning (1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>If the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and ſinner appeare?</hi> Surely, as the Prophet concludes (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.18.) <hi>According to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adverſaries, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to his enemies, to the Iſlands he will repay recompence.</hi>

                  <p>Suppoſe further. That the wicked mans outward eſtate be evill, then it is worſe to him, when he changes to outward good: if he change from ſorrow to joy, from povery to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, from ſickneſſe to health, from a priſon to liberty, in all theſe, or in any other of like nature with theſe, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to his loſſe: That man can never change for good, who continues evill. Such a mans outward eſtate often changes from bad to worſe; if it change from bad to good, that is bad for him; and if being good, it change not at all, that is worſt of all.</p>
                  <p>It is a part of the miſery of man, that his ſtate is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but that is incident to the beſt of men: We ſhall not

We may ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (conſidering the many troubles which we are ſubject to in this life) that it is a part of our happineſſe, that our ſtate is changeable. Thoſe changes which are from evill to good, or from good to better, are to be numbred among our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; ſuch are the changes of the Saints, all their changes are for the better: yea thoſe changes of the Saints which are from joy to ſorrow, from riches to poverty, from health to ſickneſſe, from liberty to a priſon, from life to death, in a word, their changes from any kinde of outward temporary good, to outward temporary evill, are yet for their good. He cannot change but for his good, who is good, and who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides alwayes under this promiſe, that all ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his good.</p>
                  <p>An evill and a good man differ in nothing more then in their changes; nor ſhould any ſelfe-conſideration provoke an evill man more to deſire that he may be changed to good, then this, that his changes may be for good.

                  </p>
                  <p>The unbeleife of man is as ſtrong againſt the threatnings, as againſt the promiſes: The Saints are hardly brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that glory ſhall be their recompence, that the purchaſe which Chriſt hath made of Heaven, and eternall happineſſe belongs to them. A wicked man will not beleeve that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguiſh ſhall be upon him, or that the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt his unrighteouſneſſe, he will not beleeve that he ſhall goe to Hell and be damned, or that everlaſting fire ſhall burne him, or the worme that dyes not, feed upon him; he that is deceived will not beleeve theſe things, and the Devill hath as great an advantage upon men, by making them ſtrong in unbeleife: As God hath, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his people ſtrong in Faith.</p>
                  <p>The firſt aſſault that ever the <hi>Devill</hi> made againſt man, was to weaken Faith, or ſtrengthen unbeleife about the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: While he laboured to deceive the Woman, he laboured as much to perſwade her, <hi>That vanity ſhould not be her recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:</hi> God had ſayd peremptorily, <hi>In the day that ye eate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yee ſhall ſurely dye:</hi> The Devill denyed as peremptorily, <hi>Yee ſhall not ſurely dye (Gen.</hi> 3.4.) The people were commanded to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to every branch of the Curſe (<hi>Deut.</hi> 27.16, 17, &amp;c.) Though it be the loweſt way of obedience to obey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we beleeve the truth, and certainty of the Curſe; yet it is a high act of obedience to beleeve it: And Satan is as buſie againſt our faith, in the threatnings, as he is againſt our faith in promiſes. This unbeleife opens the way to the committing of ſin, and ſweetens ſin while we are committing it: Were it not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48478:96"/> for this unbeliefe ſin could not be bread, much leſſe (as it is to many) pleaſant bread. Sin would be Gall and Worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in the acting of it, did we beleeve, that it will be bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the end. Who would doe the worke of ſin, did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that <hi>vanity ſhould be his recompence?</hi> Becauſe this threat is not beleeved, therefore the Law which forbids ſin, is not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As Faith is a ſheild to the new Man, ſo unbeleife is a ſheild to the old Man; as Faith quenches the fiery darts of the Devill, or his allurements to ſin; ſo unbeliefe quenches all the fiery darts of God, or his threatnings of puniſhment. Tuſh ſay they, We ſhall never ſee Sword nor Famine, we need not feare (which is ſo much talked of) death or Hell: <hi>Vanity ſhall not be our recompence.</hi>

                  <p>Beſides, a wicked man never fills his dayes, though he be full of dayes; he that is not prepared for death (how old ſoever he is) dyes before he is rype: he is rype for deſtruction, but he is neither rype nor fit for death: The youngeſt Saint that dyes, dyes rype, though he dye before he come to that eſtate,<note place="margin">Pii licet aetate juvenes, ſenes ſunt moribus.</note> wherein nature uſeth to crop men off; yet, he (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13.) is <hi>come to the fulneſſe of the ſtature of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Referring theſe words unto the eſtate of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, it ſhall be accompliſhed, or cut off before the time; that is, his pomp, and greatneſſe, all that he hath gotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (of which he ſpake in the precedent part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) ſhall be ſcattered ſuddenly.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wicked men often outlive all their worldly enjoyments:</hi> Some
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48478:98"/> live to be their owne Executors; they diſpoſe, or rather diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate all; they leave nothing when they dye, for others. The pride of wicked men ſhall have a fall, their preſent poſſeſſions and future hopes ſhall come to nought (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>Wiſedome hath length of dayes in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour:</hi> We may ſay of ſin, <hi>Shortneſſe of dayes is in its right hand, and in its left hand, poverty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</hi> The former point ſaith, that a wicked mans dayes are ſhort, he ſhall be cut off before his time, death cuts him off. The latter ſaith, his pomp, his riches and honour, all theſe ſhall be cut off before the time. We have ſeen ſome who have raiſed great eſtates by ſin, and they have ſeen an end of all in miſery.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Taking the Antecedent to be the deſignes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivements of the wicked man.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The counſells, deſignes, and contrivements of wickedmen, doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prove abortive:</hi> They are accompliſhed before their time. Their plots break out before they are ripe, and then all's ſpoyled. So it was with the Powder Plot, it was <hi>accompliſhed before the time;</hi> it was diſcovered before it could be acted; we have often ſeen grand deſignes layd in the duſt, cruſht in the ſhell, and nipt in the very bud. As the Prophet reproves ſome for ſtaying too long, in the place of breaking forth of Children (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.13.) That is, they have let their purpoſes dye under tedious conſultations, or irreſolutions for acting: So we may deride others for ſtaying too little in the place of breaking forth of Children. God in judgement haſtens them to action before their deſignes are fully matured by conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>It is accompliſhed before his time.</hi>

His hand, his arme, was not green, he could not uſe it to hurt the Prophet (<hi>Zech.</hi> 11.17.) The wicked Idoll Shepheard is threatned, <hi>His arme ſhall cleane be dryed up, and his right eye ſhall be utterly darkned:</hi> that is, He ſhall neither have counſell, nor ſtrength, he ſhall neither be able to adviſe, nor to act; his eye ſhall be darkned, ſo that he ſhall not be able to ſee his way; his arme ſhall be dryed up, he ſhall not be able to attaine his end (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.5.) <hi>None of the men of might have found their hands;</hi> as we ſay of a man that goes lamely or lazily, <hi>He cannot finde his feet;</hi> ſo of a man that acts lamely and lazily, or of a Souldier that fights faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cowardly, <hi>He cannot finde his hands;</hi> or in the language of the Text, <hi>His arme or hand is not green.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We tranſlate metaphorically, ſo the word ſignifies not a hand, but a branch; becauſe a branch or bough of a Tree puts forth from the body of it, as the hand or arme is ſtretcht from the body of a man; by this branch we may underſtand, either of thoſe two things noted before;</p>

And if Chriſt ſuffered theſe things for ſinners, himſelfe being without ſin, what ſhall thoſe ſinners ſuffer, who are without Chriſt? They like dry Trees will ſoon be conſumed by the fire of Gods wrath. So that, when he ſaith, They ſhall not be green, it is as much as to ſay, They ſhall have no ſtrength, vigour, life, nor beauty.</p>

                  <p>The firſt are ſuch as worſhip God falſely, or with falſe hearts: they draw neer to God with their lips, but their hearts are farr from him, theſe are Hypocrites, <hi>The congregation of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites ſhall be deſolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As theſe are falſe with God in his worſhip, ſo others are falſe with men in their commerce and dealings: Theſe are compriſed in the ſecond branch, <hi>Fire ſhall conſume the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48478:100"/> of bribery:</hi> Bribery is put for all ſins againſt our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and hypocriſie for all ſins againſt God. So that here we have ſinners againſt the firſt Table, and ſinners againſt the ſecond; ſinners againſt God, and ſinners againſt men; in the compaſſe of this diviſion all ſins and ſinners are contained.</p>
                  <q>The Congregation of Hypocrites.</q>
                  <p>That is, Hypocrites how many ſoever there be of them, though they be a full Congregation: Hypocrites, how ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever they are conjoyned and cemented, yet they ſhall be deſolate.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew word ſignifies, not onely to Congregate,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>A ſecond interpretation gives it thus,<note place="margin">Illa quae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregantur ab hypocrita, <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>The Congregation of hypocrites;</hi> that is, all that Hypocrites doe congregate; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they gather together, whether things or perſons, their Riches, their Honours, their Relations, all ſhall be deſolate.</p>
                  <q>Shall be deſolate:</q>
                  <p>Or <hi>barren;</hi> the word ſignifies both; that which is deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late brings forth no fruit, and that which brings forth no fruit will quickly be deſolate.</p>
                  <p>What an Hypocrite is, hath been ſhewed before, <hi>Chapter</hi> 8. therefore I will not ſtay upon it, but refer you thither, where <hi>Bildad</hi> told <hi>Job, The hope of the Hypocrite ſhall periſh:</hi> Onely note two things from the whole, <hi>The Congregation of Hypocrites ſhall be deſolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>An Hypocrite is under a curſe.</hi> Of all men in the World Hypocrites are deepeſt under a curſe: They are moſt curſed, who are moſt wicked, Hypocrites are therefore more wicked then others, becauſe they would ſeem not onely ſomewhat, but much more holy then others. It is bad enough to be bad; but it is worſe to appeare good when we are bad. They who delight in the ſhews of morall goodneſſe, when they hate, or care not for the reality of it, ſhall ſurely meet with, not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48478:101"/> ſhewes, but realities of penall evill. Their painted feigned fire of zeale ſhall be puniſhed with the true fire of Divine wrath.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hypocrites, how many ſoever they are, how ſtrongly ſoever they are confederate, how much ſoever they have gotten together, ſhall be made deſolate.</hi> It is not poſſible to make any power to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the power of God. Though like thoſe uncircumciſed Nations, <hi>Gebal, and Ammon, and Amaleck, the Philiſtims, and thoſe of Tyre,</hi> they all conſult, and lay their heads together, to make a Congregation, yet God will break them all. How long ſoever their traine be, how many ſoever their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants be, and how ſtrong ſoever their correſpondency be, yet the Congregation of Hypocrites ſhall be deſolate.</p>
                  <q>And fire ſhall conſume the Tabernacles of bribery.</q>
                  <p>Fire may be taken two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Either litterally, and ſtrictly, for the element of fire, or for ordinary fire.</p>
                  <p>Or it may be taken figuratively, and metaphorically, and ſo it ſignifies:</p>
                  <p>Either firſt, The wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, Any effect of the wrath of God, any revenge, or judgement which God powres forth on wicked men. And ſo, what judgement ſoever God ſends, we may call it a <hi>Fire,</hi> even that deluge of Water (as hath been noted) which drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the old World, was (in this ſenſe) a fire.</p>
                  <p>Divine judgements are repreſented by fire, upon theſe three grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe as fire, they break forth ſuddenly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly; they are not like the fire that is for uſe, which we are long preparing and blowing, before it will burne; but the judgements of God are like an accidentall fire, which breaks out, when no man looks for it, in a moment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Os &amp; lingua tribui ſolet igni nam dicitur lambere &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſcere.</note>Secondly, They are fire, becauſe of their deſtroying nature, ſo the Text ſpeaks, it eates up, or devoures. Fire is a great eater, fire hath a ſtrong ſtomack; what will not fire digeſt? Fire will digeſt the whole ſublunary World at laſt; <hi>The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall melt with fervent heat:</hi> Fire will digeſt Stones, Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and iron. Such is the wrath of God, nothing can ſtand
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48478:101"/> before it, it will ſubdue the hardeſt materials, and tougheſt peices. The hot ſtomack of the Oſtrich (as ſome affirme) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocts Iron; what will not the heat of Gods anger concoct, and conſume to aſhes?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a mercileſneſſe in the judgements of God, as in fire: We ſay, <hi>Fire, and Water have no mercy;</hi> there is no intreating them, they are not onely hard, but impoſſible to be intreated. Such (in reference to wicked men) is the wrath of God; as good ſpeak to fire not to burne, or to water not to drowne, as to the wrath of God not to conſume wicked men; it muſt and will doe it (<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1.) <hi>Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me,</hi> &amp;c. to intreat, yet the ſentence ſhall not be taken off, wrath muſt burn. Though prayer hath in many caſes quenched wrath, yet ſometimes the wrath of God cannot be quenched by prayer, nor intreated downe, there is no ſpeaking to it; and ſometimes that it might burn quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord hath ſayd, <hi>Pray not for this people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Fire ſhall conſume the Tabernacles of bribery.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tabernacles of bribery,</hi> may be taken two wayes: Either for the Tabernacles of thoſe who have taken bribes: Or the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of thoſe who have given bribes; for there goes (as we ſay) but a paire of Shears between him that gives, and him that takes bribes; both are of a peice,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note> and both are alike miſcheivous and wicked. Some take bribes to pervert Juſtice, and others give bribes to pervert Juſtice: Fire is prepared for both their Tabernacles; that is, for their whole eſtates, or for all that belongs unto them. Yet <hi>Eliphaz</hi> may ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ayme at bribe-takers, or unjuſt Judges (among whom he ſecretly numbers <hi>Job</hi>) who ſuffer themſelves to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with gifts, and to have their eyes put out by rewards: The Septuagint is expreſſe in that ſenſe,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Fire ſhall conſume</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Tabernacles of bribe-takers.</hi> And indeed, if there were no bribe-takers, there would be no bribe-givers: as we ſay, <hi>There would be no Theeves, if there were no Receivers.</hi> The Receiver makes the Theife; and corrupt Judges, who take bribes, make ſo many bribe-givers.</p>
                  <p>Further, The word which we tranſlate <hi>Bribery,</hi> ſignifies properly a gift; and the Text may be rendred thus, <hi>Fire ſhall conſume the Tabernacles of gifts.</hi> There are many gifts which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48478:102"/> are farr from bribes. There are five ſorts of gifts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Gifts of charity to the poore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gifts of freindſhip between equals.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gifts of duty from inferiours to thoſe above them, to teſtifie either thankfulneſſe or obedience.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Gifts of bounty and grace, from Superiours to thoſe who are below them, to teſtifie their favour to them, and that they are wel-pleaſed in them, or in their ſervices; There is no hurt either in giving or receiving theſe gifts. Theſe are onely teſtimonies of reſpect from man to man, and tend onely to maintaine humane ſociety.</p>
                  <p>But there is a fifth ſort of Gifts, which we may call gifts of injury, or in the language of the Text, Gifts of Bribery: Theſe are given, either to pervert, or delay Juſtice, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow a man and his cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew expreſſeth a gift in generall, and a bribe, by the ſame word,<note place="margin">Quid eſt <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> becauſe, as all bribes are gifts; ſo very many gifts are bribes. Gifts of charity, of freindſhip, of duty, of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, are but few in compariſon of bribing gifts. And 'tis exceeding hard for any man that is intereſſed in affaires of Judgement between man and man, to receive a gift from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, and not be brib'd by it, to tranſgreſſe the rules of equity and righteouſneſſe. A gift transformes the Judge into a party, or makes (as the Hebrew criticks tell us upon that word) the Judge and party to be but one perſon.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>The tabernacles of bribery,</hi> may be taken, not onely in generall for the eſtates of thoſe who have given or taken Bribes; but particularly for the very Houſes which have been built by giving, or taking Bribes. Some have built houſes, with what they have gotten by giving Bribes, and many by taking Bribes, have got enough to build houſes: While ſuch look on their houſes, and dwellings, they may ſay, if they will ſay the truth, <hi>Injuſtice hath built us theſe houſes; theſe are the Tabernacles of bribery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Traveller comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and viewing many famous ſtructures,<note place="margin">Haec ſunt pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cara Germano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> and goodly houſes there, asked who built them? It was anſwered, <hi>Theſe are the ſins of Germany;</hi> the meaning was, that the Money brought for Pardons out of <hi>Germany,</hi> built thoſe Houſes. So we may ſay of many faire places, and goodly dwellings, Theſe are Bribes and Oppreſſions, ſuch
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48478:102"/> a man built theſe by iniquity. Bribes may build houſes, but bribe-takers cannot protect them: <hi>The Tabernacles of bribery ſhall be conſumed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Bribery is an odious ſin:</hi> That ſin which is put to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe all ſins againſt our neighbours, muſt needs be a very odious, as well as a very comprehenſive ſin. God loves judgement, bribery oppoſeth what God loves. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands charity, as well as judgement; and delights to ſee men bountifull as well as righteous: Yet charity without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bounty without righteouſneſſe, are an abomination to God. God is a God of judgement, they that are againſt judgement, act not onely againſt the rule which God makes, but againſt the example which God gives. It is as much the honour of God, that he is a God of judgement, giving all their due; as, that he is a God of mercy, giving to all his, what they have not at all deſerved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which is ſinfully gotten, ſhall be miſerably loſt. Fire ſhall conſume the tabernacles of bribery.</hi> There is nothing gained, though much be gotten by injuſtice. Many give bribes to undoe others, and all who receive bribes, undoe themſelves. what is the advantage of any ſinfull gaine, when the fire of Gods wrath conſumes the gainer? <hi>What ſhall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his ſoule?</hi> And as the loſſe is infinite, that comes by ſin, in reference to the next life; ſo at beſt, the gaine is little, in reference to this preſent life: Either the actor of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or his Heire, ſhall finde a fire in the foundation, a fire in the Stones and Timber of his Houſe, and downe 'twill come; Bribery never bought any laſting materialls to build with. <hi>Woe be to him</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12.) <hi>that coveteth an evill covetouſneſſe; or</hi> (according to the Hebrew) <hi>that gaineth an evill gaine to his houſe, that he may ſet his neſt on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evill: Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy houſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the Stone ſhall cry out of the wall, and the beame out of the Timber ſhall anſwer it.</hi> What ſhall the ſtones cry? Or what ſhall the beame anſwer? The ſtones ſhall cry, that the morter in which they were layd, was tempered with the blood of innocents, and the beame ſhall anſwer, that it was ſet up by pulling downe the poor.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:48478:103"/>
                  <p>Thoſe are crying ſins indeed, which cauſe ſtones (that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak) to cry: And what anſwer can be given for thoſe iniquities which provoke <hi>Timber beames</hi> to anſwer? Such is the iniquity of oppreſſion and injuſtice, which are the fruits of bribery. See a paralell place (<hi>Jer.</hi> 22.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.) the ſumm of which may be drawne up into this concluſion, given by <hi>Eliphaz, Fire ſhall conſume the Tabernacles of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</hi>

                  <p>The Scripture is frequent in this metaphor; we have it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.14.) almoſt word for word, <hi>Behold he travelleth with iniquity, and hath conceived miſcheife, and hath brought forth falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. (Iſa.</hi> 59.4.) <hi>They conceive miſcheife, and bring forth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>James (Chap.</hi> 1.15.) ſpeaks the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>When luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi> All alluding to the naturall conception, formation, and production of Children. We have theſe three in the Text before us, the order of the words being a little altered.</p>
                  <p>Here is firſt, Conception, <hi>They conceive miſcheife.</hi>

                  <p>More ſtrictly to the method of <hi>Eliphaz;</hi> we have firſt, The conception; ſecondly, the birth of ſin: And as if one birth were not enough, they returne to their work, providing for a new birth of the old man, <hi>Their belly prepareth deceit.</hi>

We tranſlate <hi>miſcheife, They conceive miſcheife,</hi> or ſome
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48478:103"/> miſcheivous deviſe to the diſhonour of God: and the wrong of man.</p>
                  <q>They conceive.</q>
                  <p>Conception is here the worke of the minde, we ordinarily ſay, <hi>We conceive ſuch a thing;</hi> that is, We take it in, or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it by an act of the underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Here's the trueſt character of a wicked man, he is one that conceives miſcheife. The alluſion teacheth us:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That a wicked man ſins with much freedome of ſpirit, or he ſins freely.</hi> He conceives miſcheife. The conceptions of the minde cannot be forced, nor can the conceptions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and therefore the Law reſolves it, That there is no rape, where conception follows. Theſe conceptions are the joynt actings of the will and underſtanding, both concur in them. an unregenerate perſon is free to doe evill, he needs not be forced to it, he cannot be forced from it; and every evill is the more evill, by how much the more freely it is done. The more voluntarily we ſin, the more wickedly we ſin.</p>
                  <p>Againe, The conceptions of the minde, are deliberate, there is a collecting of one thing from another, a debating in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Wicked men ſin with deliberation.</hi> They ſit downe and meditate, they lay the frame of wickedneſſe in their hearts, and then ſet it up, or act it with their hands.</p>
                  <p>Note thirdly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All the conceptions of wicked men are wickedneſſe.</hi> They are very fruitfull in wickedneſſe, and they beare no other fruit. Miſcheife is not onely that which he conceives, but all that he conceives; he conceives nothing elſe. A wicked man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think or conceive one good thought; he may think of that which is materially good, but he conceives no good (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.) <hi>All the thoughts of the imaginations of his heart are onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and that continually.</hi> All the Creatures which he formes in his minde, all the children of his underſtanding are deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and monſtrous; <hi>He conceives miſcheife,</hi> which as it notes a continued act, ſo an act continued about, or upon the ſame object.</p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:48478:104"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be a contriver, a plotter, a conceiver of miſcheife, is worſe then then to be an actor, or a doer of miſcheife.</hi> It is ill to have a hand in any ſinfull evill, it is worſe to have a head in it, but worſt of all to have a heart in it. Conceivers of miſcheife alwayes have their hearts and heads in miſcheife; and if they are not ſtopt, will have their hands to it too: they who are plotters, and deſigners, would be actors. Hence they are called, <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity.</hi> They have an inward Shop, and an outward Shop: firſt they work it in their thoughts, and mould it there, and then it comes out. To conceive miſcheife is properly, the Devils trade, he rather deviſeth then acts wickedneſſe. There are many wickedneſſes in the World which he cannot act; but he is or would be the plotter, ſetter, and contriver of them all: This is the wickedneſſe of the Devill: and every conceiver and deviſer of miſcheife is of <hi>the Devils trade.</hi> A good man may (poſſibly) doe evill, but a wicked man deviſeth evill. As it notes the ſpiritualneſſe of a man in holineſſe, when he doth not onely act that which is good, but his heart is upon it, he conceives and frames it in his minde. So it notes a man ſpiritually wicked, when his minde frames wickedneſſe. The Apoſtle concludes of himſelfe (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25.) <hi>So then with my minde I ſerve the Law of God, but with the fleſh, the Law of ſin.</hi> Not that he willingly gave up his fleſh to ſin, but that he was carryed through the infirmity of the fleſh to ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full actings, while his minde, his deviſings and contrivings, were according to the Law of God, and he <hi>delighted in the Law of God concerning the inward man.</hi> This is the ſpiritualneſſe of holineſſe, and without this, there is no outward act of any account with God. It is what the minde moves to, not what the mouth ſpeaks, or the hand doth, which commends us to God. What is it to God that we ſerve his Law with our fleſh, if with our minds, we either ſerve the Law of ſin, or doe not ſerve the Law of God? Man is not what he acts, but what he conceives, unleſſe he act what he hath conceived. <hi>They conceive miſcheife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And bring forth vanity.</q>
                  <p>Now they come to the birth; they are in travell after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; they bring forth, and the Childs name is <hi>Vanity.</hi>

They who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive miſcheife, may bring forth any thing but what is good. Thoſe three words may ſerve the ſame thing; every vanity is a lye, and any lye is vanity, and iniquity is both lye and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The perſons of whom <hi>Eliphaz</hi> diſcourſeth are ſayd to bring forth vanity, on theſe three grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe they ſomtimes bring forth no fruit at all; they are conceiving miſcheif, but they can make nothing of it, their conceptions end in abortions; they deviſe and plot, but all is hatching of winde: The Church is ſo expreſſed, though in a different caſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.17, 18.) <hi>Like as a Woman with Childe neer the time of her delivery is in paine, and cryes out in her pangs; ſo have we been in thy ſight O Lord; Wee have beene with childe, we have been in paine:</hi> The Church had concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for good, ſhee hoped that the Lord would have done ſome great thing for her; yet after her conception, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, ſee what ſhee brings forth, <hi>We have beene in paine, and brought forth winde;</hi> that is, nothing at all, it proved a meer timpany; for ſo he explaines it, <hi>We have not wrought any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance in the earth, neither have the Inhabitants of the World fallen;</hi> that is, we have not obtained that deliverance that we hoped for in the earth, neither have our Enemies (who are called by the Prophet, <hi>The Inhabitants of the World</hi>) been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued under our power; they have not fallen. Now as the Church and people of God ſometimes are diſappointed in their expectations; they conceive, yet bring forth winde, not that Man-childe of mercy which was expected: So, much more doe wicked men, after all their pleaſing conceptions, and pangs of travell, they bring forth vanity; and their veſſell is mar'd upon the wheele.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are ſayd to bring forth vanity,<note place="margin">Parturium montes. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> or a vaine thing; becauſe what they bring forth, is not proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their expectation. Their <hi>Mountaine</hi> proves a Mole-hill or (as it was ſayd of old) <hi>a Mouſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the birth is not onely alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48478:105"/> but often quite croſſe to their expectation; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive miſcheife againſt others, and bring forth miſcheife up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on themſelves: this is vanity, yea and vexation of ſpirit, <hi>They bring forth vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve from this alluſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wicked men cannot but act evill:</hi> They who conceive, muſt doe their utmoſt to bring forth conceptions. As a Woman with Childe, cannot but bring forth when her time is come, and her paines are on her; if you would give her all the World it is impoſſible to divert or delay the birth. So it is with a wicked man, when he hath miſcheivous conceptions in his heart; <hi>He ſleepeth not unleſſe he doe miſcheife (Prov.</hi> 4.16.) What ever comes of it, fall back or fall edge, he muſt doe it. He cannot forbeare an attempt to doe it, though it coſt him his life; many have been at that coſt, in attempting to doe it but could not.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve ſecondly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wicked men are oft put to much paine in fulfilling their luſts, or in acting their conceived miſcheifes.</hi> It is with ſuch men as with the Woman in child-bearing, on whom the Lord hath layd that heavy burthen, <hi>In ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth Children (Gen.</hi> 3.16.) wicked men feele this to the full, <hi>In ſorrow they bring forth: The wicked man travelleth in paine all his dayes,</hi> verſ. 20. It is their delight to ſin, but for the moſt part they ſmart in ſinning, and run through many ſorrows to accompliſh their ſin. They are ſo mad upon ſinning, that the ſweetneſſe of doing miſcheife pleaſeth them more, then all the troubles they goe through in doing it diſcourageth them. Many evils cannot be done with eaſe, it coſts ſinners deare to effect what they deſigne; they often have, as we ſay of Women, after long and ſore travell in child-bearing, <hi>A very hard bargaine of it,</hi> and pay very deare for that which is worth, or worthy of nothing but repentance or greater paine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Taking vanity for iniquity, which ſenſe was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in opening the termes.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such as our thoughts and conceptions are, ſuch are our productions.</hi> They conceive miſcheife, and bring forth iniquity; ſuch as we plow and ſow in the minde, ſuch is the Harveſt of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: The very forme, the lineaments and portraiture of a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48478:105"/> mans ſpirit is drawne upon the things he doth; his works are the image of his heart. As it is ſayd of <hi>Adam</hi> in nature, <hi>He begat a Son in his owne likeneſſe;</hi> ſo doth every man in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Our actions are as our ſelves are, they are begotten and brought forth in our owne likeneſſe, whether good or evill, onely with this difference, Good actions are borne in our ſupernaturall likeneſſe, evill actions in our naturall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As to bring forth vanity, imports, as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, either no fruit, or that which is not ſutable to the deſignes and deſires of wicked men;</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sinfull conceptions often prove abortive, and miſcarry; they bring forth nothing, or nothing as they would have it, who have conceived them.</hi> The birth is ſometimes ſhort in degree, and not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome contrary in kinde; they have not what they expect, yea they have what they leaſt expect (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>Why doe the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vaine thing?</hi> Why a vaine thing?

                  <p>
                     <hi>An evill heart is never diſcouraged by any diſappointments from going on in evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One would have thought, after he had conceived miſcheife, and brought forth nothing but vanity, that we ſhould have heard no more of him; that he would now ſit downe and be quiet, but <hi>his belly prepareth deceit</hi> preſently, he will to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he will try once more; if he faile in one plot, he hopes to thrive in another; he will ſow his ſeed of ſin in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the evening he will not withhold his hand, and though he ſee neither of them proſper, yea though he ſee both of them blaſted, yet he will to his ſowing againe. As a gracious heart receives many diſappointments and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, but ſaith he, I will not give over, <hi>My belly ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſtill, holy, and juſt, and righteous things;</hi> and the more he is diſappointed the more holily he acts. So doth a wicked man more ſinfully; for he acts as ſtrongly and naturally in his ſtate, as a godly man doth in his; and therefore he will not be put off by diſappointments. He ſaith in the words of <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 23.35.) <hi>They have ſtricken me and I was not ſicke; they have beaten me and I felt it not, when I awake, I will ſeek it yet againe.</hi> Wicked men in generall, as well as Drunkards in particular, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> there ſpeaks, meet with many blows, and are often ſick in following their ſin; yet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are never ſick of ſin) as ſoone as ever they awake, and recover a little, they forget all their wounds and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and reſolve to ſeek it yet againe. They pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much with what is to come, that they ſleight all that hath been done, and reſolve with thoſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.12.) <hi>To morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant:</hi> They are preparing for ſin, even while they are ſinning: It is ſaid (<hi>Revel.</hi> 6.) that he on the Red Horſe, <hi>went forth conquering, and to conquer:</hi> he had not onely a preſent Conqueſt, but a project to conquer; he was actually a Conquerer, and having conquered, hee had freſh deſignes in his eye. As Chriſt goes out thus conquering, and to conquer; ſo wicked men goe out doing evill, and to doe it; deceiving, and to deceive. Their <hi>belly prepareth deceit:</hi> Though they have brought forth vanity once and againe, yet they prepare, as aſſured of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:48478:107"/>
                  <p>This ariſeth three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the extreame love and good affection which a carnall heart beares to ſin: as the love which beleevers beare to Chriſt, is not onely a motive provoking them to doe for Chriſt, but alſo to perſevere in doing for Chriſt, though they ſuffer much in doing for him; he that loves Chriſt will not onely ſweat at his worke, but bleed at his worke, if his work cannot be carryed on without bleeding. Thus alſo the love of wickedmen to their luſts, is not onely a motive provoking them to fulfill their luſts, but to endure any thing for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of them; <hi>Love is the the ſpring of labour, actions are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions put forth, and made viſible:</hi> Love is alſo the ſpring of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as well in a bad cauſe, as in a good cauſe: What is it that love dares not attempt, towards the attainement of what we love? <hi>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drowne it:</hi> Love is ſuch a vehement flame, that though you caſt the waters of ſorrow, yea floods of trouble upon it, yet theſe cannot extinguiſh it; much more then will it keep alive after many deferrs and diſappointments. It is the Obſervation of one of the Ancients, that Love built the two Cities; Holy Love built the City of God, and unholy Love built, or is daily building the City of Satan: And though it be much hindered and oppoſed in building this City; yea though the materials with which it would rayſe and fortifie this City be often ſcattered and broken, yet theſe Builders will provide more materials, <hi>Their belly prepareth deceit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This their unwearyed projecting and acting after diſcouragements and diſappointments, ariſeth from the extreame deſire they have to attaine their end. It is a true Axiom, that, <hi>The appetite of the end is infinite.</hi> Whatſoever a man propoſeth to himſelfe as his end in any undertaking, will carry him on without end till he doe attaine it: As reſt is the naturall end of motion, ſo till man hath reached his civill (though ſinfull) ends, he cannot reſt. A wicked man propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an end to himſelfe in evill actions, as well as an honeſt man doth in good: and therefore till that profit, or pleaſure, or honour, or revenge, which he propoſeth to himſelfe be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, he is unſatisfied; let God or Man put as many ſtops as they will in his way, let his firſt and ſecond and third <hi>concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of miſcheife,</hi> conclude in the <hi>bringing forth of vanity,</hi> yet he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48478:108"/> is not concluded by it, he will try a fourth and a fifth time too, <hi>His belly againe prepareth deceit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, His hope to ſpeed at laſt, put him forward to new experiments, when former ones have fayled; he perſwades himſelfe he ſhall obtaine, if he continue. As the Saints having prayed, and wayted long without an anſwer from God, yet goe on praying, <hi>their belly prepareth new prayers,</hi> becauſe they have a good ground to hope that God will heare at laſt: So ungodly men perſevere in plotting miſcheife, becauſe they have ſtrong hopes (though but the ſhadow of a ground to hope) that they ſhall one day accompliſh their deſires. As the heart would breake for ſorrow; ſo both heart and hand would breake off from labour, were it not for hope. But where hope of attaineing lives, eſpecially where it is lively, there, ſuch will labour as long as they live: Though they have hitherto been deceived in their expectation, <hi>yet their belly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth deceit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> proſecutes his dehortation; and though he ſaith not to <hi>Job,</hi> as <hi>Nathan</hi> did to <hi>David, Thou art the man;</hi> yet <hi>Job</hi> was the man he meant, <hi>the man, who</hi> (in his opinion) <hi>had conceived miſchiefe, and brought forth vanity; yea the man whoſe belly was even then preparing deceit.</hi> How much <hi>Eliphaz</hi> was deceived, appeares upon the whole matter; what <hi>Jobs</hi> belly, his minde, his inward man was preparing, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by his owne anſwer in the two Chapters following.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>And what ſayd he? His anſwer conſiſts of three generall parts.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt, he confutes what <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had aſſerted; which he doth to the eighteenth Verſe of this ſixteenth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He proceeds to corroborate and confirme his owne Tenet, or Opinion; which he doth to the eleventh Verſe of the ſeventeenth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He renewes his former complaints, and deſires; which he doth from that eleventh Verſe to the end of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of his anſwer, is confutation; and he begins his confutation with an accuſation; with an accuſation of thoſe who had diſputed with him: and that's the ſubject of theſe five Verſes, in all which he taxeth, or checks his freinds for
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48478:109"/> their unfreindly &amp; uncomly dealing with him; and he checks them (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had done him at the beginning of the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer Chapter) upon five points of errour and unfreindlineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For ſpeaking unprofitably, or for telling him no more then he knew before, at the entrance of the ſecond Verſe, <hi>I have heard many ſuch things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He chargeth them for ſpeaking <hi>ſuch things,</hi> as did rather increaſe, and boyle up, then mittigate, and allay his ſorrow, <hi>Miſerable comforters are yee,</hi> in the cloſe of the ſecond Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He accuſeth them for ſpeaking ſo much, or for endleſſe ſpeaking; their diſcourſe was tedious, they would not give over, Thus he takes them up at the third Verſe, <hi>Shall vaine words have an end?</hi> What, will you be endleſſe? Will you never have done?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He accuſeth them for their cauſeleſſe ſpeaking, in the ſame third Verſe, <hi>What emboldeneth thee?</hi> (or what provoketh thee) <hi>that thou anſwereſt?</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Have I given thee any cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, He reproveth his and their whole car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards him, by a ſerious profeſſion of his contrary carriage, or that he was purpoſed to deale better with them, upon ſuppoſition that they were in his caſe; and this he doth two wayes,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Telling them what he could doe, if they were in his caſe; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>I alſo could ſpeake as you doe, if your ſoule were in my ſoules ſtead, I could heap up words againſt you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>We finde this point toſſed both wayes; <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that he ſpake but ordinary matter, and he telling them that they ſpake ſo too. <hi>Bildad</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> with it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.2. <hi>How long wilt thou ſpeake theſe things? And how long
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48478:109"/> ſhall the words of thy mouth be like a ſtrong winde:</hi> as if he had ſayd, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt impertinently, or what thou ſpeakeſt doth not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the point in hand, it comes not up to the matter; yea it is quite beſides the marke.</hi> And ſo <hi>Zophar (Chap.</hi> 11.2.3.) <hi>Should not the multitude of words be anſwered? And ſhould a man full of talke be juſtified?</hi> Thou doeſt but <hi>Verba dare,</hi> thou ſpeakeſt to little purpoſe, or little to the purpoſe, though thou ſpeakeſt much.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> puts the ſame language upon him (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15.2, 3.) <hi>Should a wiſe man utter vaine knowledge, and fill his belly with the Eaſt winde? Should he reaſon with unprofitable talke? Or with ſpeeches wherewith he can doe no good?</hi> Thus his Freinds accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of that for which he now accuſeth them; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had accuſed them once and againe of this before: So (<hi>Chap.</hi> 12.2, 3.) <hi>Who knoweth not ſuch things as theſe?</hi> They are but vulgar truths which you have told me; and (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1, 2.) <hi>Loe mine eye hath ſeen all this, mine eare hath heard, and underſtood it, what yee know, the ſame doe I know alſo; I am not inferiour to you.</hi> You produce nothing all this while, but what I am well acquainted with; which is fully the ſenſe of this Verſe: <hi>I have heard many ſuch things:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Rhetorico modo principium, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ab extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atione, vice quippe defenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris agit. <hi>Pined.</hi> Defenſor cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam fuiſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabit ſi poteſt, aut eam vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentur exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuabit. <hi>Cic. l. 2. ad Heren.</hi>
                     </note> Every man can ſpeak as much as this. Here <hi>Job</hi> playes the Oratour, or Rhetorician, whoſe buſineſſe and deſigne (as the great Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor tells us) is as much as he can to extenuate, and lay low the arguments, or reaſons, of him that he oppoſeth. <hi>Job</hi> ſtands as Defendant here, his Freinds as Plaintifs; therefore he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to render their Charge weak, and what they ſayd ſinnewleſſe, <hi>I have heard many ſuch things as theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> doth not accuſe his Freinds, as giving out falſe and erroneous Doctrine; for himſelfe had heard and learned thoſe things before; but he accuſeth them for bringing proofes, which were not to the purpoſe, or which were in ſufficient to prove their purpoſe: As if he ſayd, <hi>I expected when you would produce ſome ſtronger arguments to maintaine your opinion, or clearer anſwers unto mine: I waited for ſome new matter, and to have heard ſomewhat that I had not heard before, but you have deceived my expectation:</hi> For, <hi>I have heard many ſuch things as theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Some truths are of very common obſervation:</hi> Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſuch things as theſe? Every Childe that hath been Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſed,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48478:110"/> knowes them. 'Tis no diſparagement to any truth, that it hath been often heard, and is commonly knowne. The more common a truth is, the more weighty it may be. Yet,</p>
                  <p>Which gives us a ſecond Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ordinary truths will not ſerve in extraordinary caſes, and that which every man knows and heares, will not reſolve us in thoſe points which few men know or heare:</hi> As <hi>Jobs</hi> Perſon was a <hi>Phaenix</hi> in the World, his age afforded not his ſecond, <hi>There is none like him in the earth,</hi> ſaith God himſelfe to Satan (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.8.) So <hi>Jobs</hi> condition was a <hi>Phaenix,</hi> it had no ſecond; there was no man tryed like him in the whole earth; and therefore his caſe eould not be meaſured by the common Standard, or rule of Providence. <hi>He had need heare that which was never heard before, who beares and feeles that which was never borne nor felt before.</hi> There are ſome temptations on afflictions, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.) <hi>Which are common to man:</hi> Common truths may comfort and ſatisfie the conſciences of ſuch. But there are temptations (ſuch were <hi>Jobs</hi>) which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to man, we can hardly finde their paralell, or a preſident of them in the Records of any Age: Common truths will not comfort, nor ſatisfie the conſciences of ſuch. Every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation hath a doctrine ſuitable to it; diſpenſations which are ſeldome ſeen call up doctrines which are ſeldome heard.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> complaines that he heares onely thoſe things which he had often heard.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It troubles a man in trouble, to be often preſſed with the ſame thing:</hi> A man at eaſe is pained with unneceſſary repetitions; much more a man in paine: and though they who like and love the things which they have heard, doe both love and like to heare them often; yet (in ſome caſes) they may heare them too often. Some indeed ſpeak very prophanely, what <hi>Job</hi> ſpake juſtly, who when they would not put off ſubmiſſion to, and attendance upon holy Doctrine, ſay, we know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we goe, what he will ſay: We know ſuch things as the Preacher uſually ſpeaks; what can he tell us, that we have not heard before? That's the language of the prophane; <hi>We know as much as he can teach us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though it be granted, that a man knowes as much as the Preacher can tell him, yet he ought to heare it againe. Though
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48478:110"/> the matter be knowne before, yet to heare it often may work a better knowledge, and leave a ſtronger impreſſion upon the heart then ever. 'Tis profitable to write the ſame things, therefore it cannot be unprofitable to heare them (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>Brethren, to write the ſame things, to me, it is not greivous, and to you it is profitable:</hi> If to write, then to ſpeake the ſame things is profitable. In the Story of the Acts of the Apoſtles, when <hi>Paul</hi> had preached in the Synagogue; the Jewes being gone, the Gentiles beſought him, That thoſe words might be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the next Sabbath (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.42.) The repeating and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating the ſame thing, is not alwayes blameable, and it is ſometimes deſireable: but when a man is under ſore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and temptations, when he is burthened with many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, it is very greivous to have thoſe things that have been often anſwered or aſſented to, againe objected, or aſſerted. A weake ſtomack muſt have variety and change, to entice the appetite, and ſo muſt a troubled and diſtempered ſpirit: <hi>I have heard many ſuch things:</hi> And hereupon he infers:
<q>Miſerable comforters are yee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had ſayd, This is a miſerable way of comforting, alway to be beating upon, and inculcating the ſame thing; <hi>Job</hi> calls his Freinds, <hi>Phyſitians of no value, (Chap.</hi> 13.4.) Here he expounds himſelfe, while he calls them, <hi>Miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters:</hi> He is a Phyſitian of no value, who in ſtead of curing, increaſeth the diſeaſe; and he is a miſerable comforter, who in ſtead of abating our ſorrow adds to it, and heightens it, <hi>Miſerable comforters are yee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems the Freinds of <hi>Job</hi> (at leaſt to his ſenſe) had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the deſigne they propoſed to themſelves when they firſt undertook this viſit, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.11.) <hi>They made an appointment together, to come, and mourne with him, and to comfort him.</hi> That was the intendment of <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds at their fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Some while they goe about to act the part of comforters, doe but add to their ſorrow, whom they pretend to comfort; and in ſtead of comforters prove tormenters.</hi> But when doth a man deſerve this title, <hi>A miſerable comforter?</hi> That which cauſed <hi>Job</hi> to charge
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48478:111"/> his Freinds with this miſcarriage of their paines with him, will reſolve the queſtion, and tell us, when.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They gave him little hope of good, or they did not open to him a doone of hope wide enough: 'tis true, they made ſome overtures that way, which yet (comparatively to what they ought) were ſcarce conſiderable. And <hi>Eliphaz</hi> who had been ſomewhat large upon the point in his firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe with <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeakes nothing of it in his laſt: For as if he thought his caſe deſperate, and had given him for a loſt man, he ſhuts up in the darke, as we ſee, in the cloſe of the former Chapter; where he thunders out the judgements of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hypocrites, and Bribe-takers, without ſo much as one word of comfort to the penitent: This is to be a <hi>Miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi> The ſong of comforters ſhould at leaſt be mixt, like that of <hi>David</hi> to the Lord, <hi>of mercy and of judgement (Pſal.</hi> 101.1) A ſong of judgement alone, or moſt of judgement to a heavy heart, may be called (like that of <hi>Jeremie) A Lamentation,</hi> but it is not <hi>a Conſolation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, They (as was toucht before) tyred out his afflicted ſoule with tedious diſcourſes, and unpleaſing repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; they alwayes harped upon the ſame ſtring, and that makes no muſicke to a diſconſolate ſoule. As God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of thoſe prayers as unpleaſing, which are full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary repetitions; ſo alſo thoſe counſels are unpleaſing to man, which are made up of needleſſe repetitions. To preſſe the ſame point, though true, oft, and oft, is a wearineſſe to the ſpirit; and becauſe it ſuggeſts this ſuſpition, that the hearer doth oppoſe, or reſiſt that truth, it proves an upbraiding, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a teaching, or a comforting: Comfort muſt be ſtolne in unawares, by a holy ſleight of hand, it muſt not be beaten in with beetles, as it were, by force of hand.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>and an ornament of fine Gold, ſo is a wiſe reprover upon an obedient eare.</hi> What he ſpeakes of a reprover is as true of a comforter; and he onely is fit to be a reprover, who is skil'd, or knowes how to be a comforter.

We muſt not load, but guide a man with counſell, nor muſt we burden him with many, but eaſe him with pertinent words of comfort.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That which rendered them yet more miſerable Comforters, was, their unkinde grating upon that ſtring of his ſinfulneſſe and ſtudyed hypocriſie. <hi>Job</hi> acknowledged himſelfe a ſinner, and that he could not be juſtified in the ſight of God by any righteouſneſſe of his owne; yet ſtill his freinds were unſatisfied about his ſincerity; and ſtill they preſented him with ſuſpicions of ſecret wickedneſſe, as the cauſe of all his ſufferings; ſtill they told him of the ſad fate of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, of Oppreſſours, of unjuſt Judges, of unſound, and falſe-hearted Worſhippers; and though they did not apply theſe Parables perſonally to <hi>Job,</hi> yet the generall diſcourſe ſounded, as if they had ſayd, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning death (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56.) ſo we may ſay concerning any affliction, <hi>The ſting of affliction is ſin;</hi> the ſting of ſickneſſe, the ſting of poverty, the ſting of diſgrace is ſin: when the leaſt trouble is armed with ſin, the ſtrongeſt tremble at the ſight of it. A godly man can eaſier beare the weight of all afflictions, then the weight and burthen of one ſin; ſo long as he ſees all cleare between God and his owne ſoule; ſo long as he can looke up to God, as having his ſin pardoned, and can approve his heart to God, that he lives not in any knowne ſin; in this caſe, though the Lord lay the heavieſt burthen of affliction upon him, he can goe lightly under it; <hi>The ſpirit of a man will beare all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:</hi> but if his ſpirit be wounded, either with the guilt of ſin, or with the feare of the wrath of God, how can hee
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48478:112"/> beare it? This afflicts more then all other afflictions. This was it which cauſed <hi>Job</hi> to cry out, <hi>Miſerable comforters:</hi> His Freinds ever upbraiding him with his ſin, his ſin, his ſin, as the root, and therefore as the ſting of all his troubles. They applyed nothing but theſe corraſives to his wounded ſoule, which called alowd for the balme of <hi>Gilead.</hi> There are two ſorts of miſerable comforters.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They who flatter the ſoule that lives in ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They who embitter, and burden their ſoules, who being under burdens of ſorrow, are alſo in bitterneſſe for their ſin.</p>
                  <p>Some ſow Pillowes under the elbowes of thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſin, and dawbe them up with untempered morter; others thruſt Swords, and ſhoot arrowes into the bowels of thoſe, who mourne for ſin, and in ſtead of bringing well-tempered morter to binde and cement their ſoules, lay hard ſtones under them, which vex and gaul their ſoules. Both are <hi>Miſerable comforters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They who undertake the office of comforting others, ſhould conſider theſe three things eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The nature of the affliction, whether internall, or externall; that which will comfort a man in bodily afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will not doe it in ſoule afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The degree, or meaſure of the affliction: If the Playſter be too narrow for the Soare, how can it heale?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They ſhould conſider the temper of the Perſon afflicted, if he be preſſed in conſcience for ſin, they ſhould not preſſe his conſcience with ſin; much leſſe ſhould they thunder out judgement and terrour againſt him for ſin; if he be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak they ſhould uſe few words; if he be paſſionate, they ſhould uſe gentle words, leſt, in ſtead of perſwading, they provoke his ſpirit: Many a ſoule is caſt downe, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in deſpaire by the ignorance or unfaithfulneſſe of thoſe who would bee called Comforters, and Supporters: (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.19.) <hi>They ſlay the ſoules that ſhould not dye, and ſave them alive, that ſhould not live.</hi> Unskilfull Phyſitians of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, kill more then bodily diſeaſes. And though the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of ſoule-phyſitians doth not indeed kill ſoules that ſhould dye (for 'tis their owne ſin that kils them) nor can kill the ſoules that ſhould not dye (for the medicine of Chriſts
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48478:113"/> moſt precious blood, will heale and ſave ſuch from their ſins) yet unskilfull ſoule-phyſitians ſhall be judged and dealt with, as having done all this, becauſe they have done their utmoſt to doe it; which is alſo the meaning of that Text (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11.) <hi>And through thy knowledge ſhall the weake brother periſh, for whom Chriſt dyed:</hi> that is, an indiſcreet uſe of that liberty which thy knowledge teacheth thee, doth that which may be accounted a deſtroying of thy weake Brother. As that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo the ignorance before ſpoken of, ſlayes the ſoules that ſhould not dye. As it requires the power, ſo the wiſedome and teachings of God to comfort and extricate poore ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ules, in and from the Labyrinth of their ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned:</hi> What to doe? <hi>That I ſhould know how to ſpeake a word in ſeaſon to him that is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (Iſa.</hi> 50.4.) It is a great peice of learning to ſpeak aright to a weary ſoule, to deale with them ſo, as neither to flatter them in their ſins, nor oppreſſe them under their ſins; to deale with them ſo in th ir affliction, as that we neither cauſe them to ſleight the hand of God, nor yet to ſink under it. He that can guid and ſteer the courſe of a ſoule that is afflicted and toſſed with the tempeſt of ſin and ſorrow, between this rock and gulfe, the Scylla of preſumption, and the Charybdis of deſpaire; he is a learned Pilot indeed.</p>
                  <p>This learning is the ſpeciall gift of God; Chriſt himſelfe acknowledgeth that the Lord his Father had given him the tongue of the learned for this end. This learning is not taught in the Schooles of men: Philoſophers and Oratours never taught ſuch an art of conſolation; nor can it be attained by the bare teaching of the holyeſt Doctors and Preachers of Divine truths. Wee may have a rich furniture of materials for this worke, and yet make no worke of it, nor be able to put truths and conſciences rightly together, unleſſe <hi>the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting teach us.</hi> As the Prophet brings in our great Maſter and Tutor in this heavenly ſcience, againe confeſſing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1.) <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath annoynted me to preach good tydings to the meek, he hath ſent me to binde up the broken hearted, to proclaime liberty to the Captives.</hi> Till we are annoynted by God, we cannot ſpeake effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to man; without the ſpirit who is the comforter, wee prove but miſerable comforters, we bungle at the work, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48478:113"/> rather undoe ſoules, then doe them any good: Wee may Preach <hi>good tydings, good newes,</hi> from Heaven (the Goſpel is nothing elſe but good newes) yet no good comes of it, till the good ſpirit comes with it, both inſtructing the hearts of thoſe that heare, and the tongues of thoſe that ſpeake, duely to apply the word.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place, ſaith, <hi>Some Comforters, have but one ſong to ſing, and they have no regard to whom they ſing it:</hi> All perſons, all eſtates, and all conditions are alike to them. The wiſedome of a comforter conſiſts in diſcerning and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe differences; As the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> hints unto us (<hi>Ver.</hi> 22, 23.) <hi>And of ſome have compaſſion, making a difference; and others ſave with feare:</hi> As faith ſaves all, ſo (in a ſenſe) feare ſaves ſome; that is, they muſt be terrifyed and made afraid, that they may be ſaved. <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds would needs ſave him with feare, whereas they ſhould have had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him, and have ſpoken kindly to him: Becauſe they could not make this difference, therefore they tooke a wrong courſe with him, and were juſtly taxed without diſtinction, <hi>Miſerable comforters are yee all.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, When they have no ſolid reaſon, no ſubſtance in them: reaſon is the ſubſtance of words, and ſo is truth;

Pride is a winde within us, vaine words are a winde without us: the proud man knowes not how to eaſe himſelfe of this winde within, but by breaking it out in words.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Words are windy when they have much paſſion in them, when they are angry and furious; an angry man blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters rather then ſpeakes, and makes a noiſe rather then a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. While <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 39.2, 3.) <hi>was dumb with ſilence, while he held his peace from good, his ſorrow was ſtirred, his heart was hot within him, and while hee was muſing, the fire kindled:</hi> While ſome are even hoarſe with ſpeaking, while they cannot hold their peace from evill, their anger is ſtirred, their hearts are ſtorming within them, and all their talke is onely a winde blowing without them.</p>
                  <p>We read of a ſtrange diſtemper in two ſorts of men, who ought of all others to be moſt compoſed and temperate (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.7.<note place="margin">Iſh ruach.</note>) <hi>The Prophet is a foole, the ſpirituall man is madd:</hi> Our Tranſlators put in the Margin, <hi>The man of the ſpirit:</hi> for <hi>Ruach</hi> in Hebrew, ſignifieth both the winde that blowes in the ayre, and the ſpirit of God which moveth in our hearts: We take that ſenſe, <hi>The ſpirituall man, or the man of the ſpirit;</hi> that is, the man that pretends to have, or ſhould have the ſpirit of God (his buſineſſe lying wholly in ſpirituals) this man <hi>is madd;</hi> he is ſo farr from acting to the height of thoſe graces which the ſpirit gives, that he acts below that reaſon which nature gives.</p>
                  <p>Yet the Originall may be rendred thus (and ſo diverſe learned Hebricians render it) <hi>The man of winde, or the windy man, is madd:</hi> Anger is a ſhort madneſſe, and he that ſpeakes angerly, is in danger to ſpeak madly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds were not men of winde, nor were they madd, and the words which they ſpake had a generall ſenſe and ſavor

                  <p>The Hebrew word which we tranſlate an end, ſprings from a root which ſignifies to <hi>cut off,</hi> becauſe every end, whether of time, or things, is the cutting off of that time or thing, the end of which it is. While <hi>Job</hi> askes the Queſtion, <hi>Shall vaine words have an end?</hi> He ſpeakes the vehemency of his owne deſire and expectation, to ſee an end of them. I ſhall not ſtay here to give any obſervations upon theſe words, but referr the Reader to the Texts before alleadged, in the eighth and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapters, where this expreſſion is more fully opened: Onely Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Vaine words are very burdenſome to a ſerious eare, much more to a ſad heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It is good to end that quickly, wee ſhould not have begun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Profitable words may be too long continued, but unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table words cannot be too ſoon ended: It is beſt not to ſpeak vainely, and it is next beſt to ceaſe, or give over ſuch kinde of ſpeaking quickly. There is a time to be ſilent from good words, as well as a time to ſpeake them; but there is no time to ſpeake evill words; all times, in reference to them, are times of ſilence. An <hi>Apoſiopoſis,</hi> or ſudden ſtop of ſpeech, is the moſt ſutable figure of Rhetorick which they can uſe, who ſpeake unſutably. As the end of what wee ſay or doe well is beſt, ſo the ending of what wee ſay or doe amiſſe is beſt. Perſeverance in every good word and worke is Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and the higheſt perfection of duty, but perſeverance in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48478:115"/> an evill, whether word or worke, is Diabolicall, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt departure from duty. Let not thy mouth open to utter vanity; but if it doth, ſhut it quickly: be not heard ſpeaking that twice, which ſhould not be ſpoken once.</p>

Give me a reaſon; what is it that ſtirrs thee to reply upon me, <hi>What emboldeneth thee to anſwer?</hi> The Hebrew word ſignifies, firſt, <hi>to ſtrengthen, to fortifie, or confirme;</hi> he that is ſtrengthened, is emboldened.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes wonderingly, his reaſon was at a loſſe about the cauſe of his Freinds boldneſſe, and therefore he admires it: There are two things which may embolden a man to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>

                  <p>Upon theſe grounds, the youngeſt <hi>David</hi> may be bold to enter the Liſts, and dare the Combate with the ſtrongeſt <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah.</hi> But there are two other things which uſually embolden men to anſwer.</p>

                  <p>They who are thus emboldened, will not give over anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though they have no further light of truth, or reaſon to hold out in their anſwers: <hi>Job</hi> ſurely had ſuch apprehenſions of his Freind <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> which moved him to aske, <hi>What embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth thee that thou anſwereſt?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Such is the ſtifneſſe and vanity of ſome, that they will hold on a contention, though they have no further grounds of truth or reaſon to continue it upon.</hi>

                  <p>They will ſpeake on though it be the ſame thing, onely in a new dreſſe of words.

                     </note> or <hi>What imbitters thy ſpirit that thou anſwereſt?</hi> As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Surely Eliphaz my fayre diſcourſe with thee, ſhould have ſtopped the courſe of this ſevere proceeding with me before this time; thou haſt loaded me with hard words, and uncharitable jealouſies; but have I ſpoken provokingly, or bitterly to thee? My conſcience tells me that I have not, and thou knoweſt I have not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that impartially reads over <hi>Jobs</hi> anſwers to <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> may finde here and there a ſowre paſſage; but as we ſay Proverbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>You muſt give looſers leave to ſpeake.</hi> The wiſe Phyſitian heares his Patient giving him uncomely language, yet will not heare it, much leſſe retort or anſwer ſo againe: They who are in paine muſt be borne with; though they provoke, it muſt not be called a provocation; and though they give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, yet it muſt not be taken. When the Childe cryes, the Nurſe ſings: God himſelfe beares with the manners of his people (ſo the word intimates, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.18.) as a Mother doth with a froward Childe; and ſo ſhould we with the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of our weake and afflicted Brethren. So that in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48478:116"/> this ſenſe, the provocations which <hi>Job</hi> gave his Freinds, were not to be reckoned as provocations; and he might well ſay to <hi>Eliphaz, What provoketh thee to anſwer?</hi> If I (in the caſe I am in) have ſpoken paſſionately, Wilt thou be provoked by it? Thou ſhouldeſt not. Thou oughteſt to paſſe it by and cover it with the garment of charity.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, we may take the words as a totall denyall of any provocation given on his part.</p>
                  <p>Whence Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some will ſpeake harſhly to, and of thoſe who never provoked, or gave them cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Water runs cleare till 'tis troubled and ſtirr'd by ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward violence: But the ſpirits of ſome men run muddy, though nothing from without ſtirrs them. The Prophet compares all wicked men to <hi>the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt (Iſa.</hi> 57.20.) The Sea is not alwayes troubled, when the Windes are quiet, that is quiet; wee often ſee a ſmooth Sea, as ſmooth as Glaſſe: A wicked man is like the Sea when 'tis enraged, he is ſuch a Sea as knows no calme; he is like the Sea, not onely when it is troubled, but when it cannot reſt. Though no breath of Winde from abroad offend him, yet he ſtormes: He hath luſts in his owne bowels, which provoke him when nothing elſe doth; yea thoſe luſts within provoke him, when all without labour to pacifie him.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>David</hi> complaines (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.5, 7.) <hi>Woe is mee that I ſojourne in Meſech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar;</hi> that is, With the Sons or deſcendants of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who have learned of their Father to mock and perſecute; I dwell in the Tents of <hi>Kedar:</hi> But what cauſed them to mock and perſecute? Was it any provocation that <hi>David</hi> had given them? No, for he ſaith in the next words, <hi>I am for peace</hi> (I would live quietly with all my heart) but when I ſpeake, they are for Warr. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Peace, becomes a provocation to Warr? It is ſinfull to ſpeake raſhly, or harſhly, though we are provoked; what is it then to ſpeake ſo when we are not provoked? <hi>They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred Moſes at the waters of ſtrife, they provoked his ſpirit;</hi> yet <hi>it went ill with Moſes for their ſakes, when he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips (Pſal.</hi> 106.32, 33.) But what was this unadviſed ſpeech. <hi>Moſes</hi> reports his owne infirmity (<hi>Numb.</hi> 20.10, 11.)
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48478:116"/> 
                     <hi>And Moſes and Aaron gathered the Congregation together before the rocke; and he ſayd unto them, Heare now yee Rebels, muſt we fetch you water out of this Rock? And Moſes lift up his hand, and with his Rod he ſmote the Rock twice,</hi> &amp;c. The errour of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this buſineſſe was twofold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he did not onely ſmite the Rock, but ſmite it twice with the Rod in his hand, whereas he had order onely, to <hi>take the Rod in his hand, and ſpeake to the Rock before their eyes, and it ſhould give out water (Verſ.</hi> 8.)</p>
                  <p>His ſecond errour was, that he did not onely ſpeake to the people (for which in that tranſaction he had no order from God) but ſpake bitterly and harſhly to them, calling them <hi>Rebels,</hi> and ſlighting them <hi>Muſt we fetch water for you, &amp;c?</hi> What, for you, who are a murmuring and gainſaying people? God knew the ſtubborneneſſe of that people, and their rebellions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, yet he did not call them <hi>Rebels,</hi> but ſayd in the cloſe of the eighth Verſe, <hi>So ſhalt thou give the Congregation, and their Beaſts drinke.</hi> God had more reaſon and power to call them <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> then <hi>Moſes</hi> had, yet he did not. And becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> did, that unadviſed ſpeech of his, and the actions which attended it, were called Rebellion, at the twenty fourth Verſe of the ſame Chapter. <hi>Yee</hi> (ſaith the Lord of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron) rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my word at the waters of Meribah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if <hi>Moſes</hi> was thus reproved and cenſured by God himſelfe, for ſpeaking paſſionately, to a people who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked both God their Deliverer, and him their Leader; what reproofe doe they deſerve, who, either upon none, or very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle provocation, call their Brethren, <hi>Hypocrites, Hereticks, Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, Rebels, perjured perſons, men of proſtituted conſciences, or at leaſt, of unſettled and uncertaine Principles;</hi> will not the Lord take notice of this bitterneſſe, even in thoſe who are his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Servants, towards their fellow-ſervants, when he layd ſo heavy a penalty (as non-admiſſion into the promiſed Land) upon a payre of the moſt eminent and faithfull Servants that ever he called forth to his work, ſince he layd the foundations, of the World?</p>
                  <p>This fals heavy upon the preſent age: Whence is that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, that Gall and Wormewood which fals from many, both tongues and Pens every day?

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48478:117"/> and ſome doe but give Gall for Gall, and Wormewood for Wormewood; yet it cannot be denyed, but that many ſpeak and write bitterly, when they have had no provocation; yea moſt who ſpeake bitterly, have been treated gently, and few who anſwer angerly will be able to give a good account what hath provoked them thus to anſwer; and how much ſoever any man hath been provoked, the Lord may juſtly make him ſmart for ſuch ſmartneſſe in anſwering. <hi>It will not beare us out in acting or ſpeaking beſides the rule, becauſe others doe ſo.

                  <p>It is our duty to conſider before we ſpeake, as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we act; and to put our ſelves to ſome trouble in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what we have to ſay, before we give others the trouble of hearing it. When God cals us to ſpeake, either in our owne defence, or for the edification of others, on a ſudden, we may expect (according to the promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.19.) <hi>That it ſhall be given us in that houre what we ſhall ſpeake.</hi> If the providence of God ſtraiten us, the ſpirit of God will enlarge us; that promiſe will helpe us, when wee have no time to prepare our ſelves, but it will not, if wee neglect the time in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48478:117"/> which vve ſhould prepare our ſelves: For when Chriſt ſaith in that place, Take no thought how or what yee ſhall ſpeake; we muſt expound it like that (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25.) <hi>Take no thought for your life, what yee ſhall eate, or what yee ſhall drinke;</hi> Which is not a prohibition of all thought about thoſe things, but onely of thoſe thoughts which are diſtracting and diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

                     <hi>Job</hi> having reproved his Freinds theſe three wayes, for the manner of their dealing with him; Now reproves them by a ſerious profeſſion of his better dealing with them; in caſe (as we commonly ſay) <hi>The Tables were turned,</hi> they comming in his place, and he in theirs: This he doth in the two Verſes following.</p>

                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A good man doth not wiſh ill to thoſe who have rewarded him with evill upon any other termes, then a diſcovery of his owne goodneſſe.</hi> 'Tis ſin to wiſh that they who are in a comfortable condition, might fall into our miſery, though they have been miſerable comforters to us in our miſery.

                  <p>Or ſecondly, That God may give an experiment of his graciouſneſſe towards them, in doing them good by their afflictions.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah (Chap.</hi> 14.10.) foreſhewes how they vvho had been vveakened by the power of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over vveakned <hi>Babylon, All they ſhall ſpeake and ſay unto thee, Art thou alſo become weake as we?

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48478:119"/> of any man, much leſſe can they wiſh them weake that they might have an opportunity to rejoyce over them. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Priſoner, and in bonds, yet he did not wiſh the worſt of his Enemies in Priſon, or in Bonds with him; he onely wiſht that they might enjoy the ſame liberty by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe enjoyed. For when he had almoſt perſwaded King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> to become a Chriſtian, he ſayd, <hi>I would to God, that not thou onely, but alſo all that heare me this day, were both almoſt, and altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe bonds (Acts</hi> 26.28, 29.) I would keep my chaines, and troubles to my ſelfe, I would have none of you know my ſorrows; but I would that all your ſoules were in as good a ſtate as mine, and knew my comforts. <hi>A holy heart wiſheth all well, as well as it ſelfe;</hi> and if at any time he wiſheth that to the worſt of his enemies, which is penally evill, he doth it with an eye both to their ſpirituall and eternall good.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the words as they are read in the forme of a wiſh.</p>
                  <p>We read them as a Suppoſition, <hi>If your ſoules were in my ſoules ſtead:</hi> And then the two latter branches muſt be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as acts of unfreindlineſſe, ſhewing what <hi>Job</hi> could, but would not doe, as was toucht before.</p>
                  <q>I could heap up words againſt you.</q>
                  <p>That is, I could make long ſpeeches, and enlarge my ſelfe in diſcourſe, I could ſpeake terrour, and thunder out whole volleys of threats againſt you; I could deafe your eares with loud voyces, and ſad your hearts with heavy cenſures.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>A godly man hath a power to doe that evill which he hath no will to doe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A carnall man hath a will to many evills, for which hee hath no power or opportunity: A godly man would not doe any evill, how much power and opportunity ſoever he hath. And indeed though he hath a naturall, or civill, yet hee hath not a morall power to doe any evill. In which ſenſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes of a regenerate perſon, (1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9.) <hi>He that is borne of God cannot ſin:</hi> He hath a naturall power to ſin any ſin, to lye, to be drunk, to be uncleane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He may have a civill power to oppreſſe, to deceive, to wrong his Brother; yet he cannot turne either his hand or his heart to ſuch works as theſe are: he hath learned better, and is better. He is borne of God, his blood and pedigree is ſo high, that hee cannot meddle, nor trade in ſuch low things. <hi>Wiſedome is too high for a foole</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 24.7.) <hi>and folly is too low for a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48478:120"/> wiſedome.</hi> When <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſolicited by his Miſtreſſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit folly with her, he anſwers, <hi>How can I doe this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, and ſin againſt God (Gen.</hi> 39.9.) <hi>Joſeph</hi> wanted ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power, nor opportunity to doe that wickedneſſe; yet he ſaith, <hi>How can I doe it?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellow-Apoſtles had wit and parts ſufficient to oppoſe the truth, yet he ſaith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.) <hi>We can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the truth, but for the truth. Paul</hi> was a great doer, and he ſaith (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13.) <hi>I can doe all things through Chriſt ſtrengthening of me;</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> could doe nothing to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chriſt. Doubtleſſe <hi>Paul</hi> could have maintained an argument, and drive on an objection as farr as another man, againſt the truth, if he would have ſet himſelfe to it, and have made that his buſineſſe; but hee had not a minde to doe it: The bent of his ſpirit did not lye that way, hee was all for Chriſt, and the Goſpell; he was a Giant for the truth, but an Infant, a weakling, as weake as water againſt it; hee had neither an underſtanding to conceive, nor a tongue to ſpeake to the diſſervice of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is a good obſervation of one of the Ancients, upon this place,<note place="margin">Narrat juſtus quid facere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit, ſed ne ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiam deſerat, quod facere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit declinat. <hi>Greg.</hi>

                     <hi>A juſt man declares what he can doe, but that hee may not deſert Juſtice, he forbeares to doe what he can.</hi> The providence of God ſets bounds to the power of a carnall man, but the ſpirit of God ſets bounds to the power of a holy man; if a carnall man keep within compaſſe at any time, it is becauſe he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained; but a godly man keeps within compaſſe, becauſe he is renewed. <hi>Laban</hi> tels <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 31.29.) <hi>It is in the power of my hand to doe thee hurt:</hi> And vvhy did not <hi>Laban</hi> hurt <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob?</hi> Was it from any principle of love or righteouſneſſe in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> breaſt? The Text is ſilent in that, and <hi>Laban</hi> himſelfe ſeems to tell us, whence it was, in the ſame Verſe, <hi>The God of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpake unto me yeſternight, ſaying, Take thou heede that thou ſpeake not to Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. And this his ſpeaking to <hi>Laban, Jacob</hi> cals, <hi>Gods rebuking of Laban (Verſ.</hi> 42.) implying, that if God had not ſtopt him, he would have done him hurt.</p>
                  <p>It was more then once in the power of <hi>Davids</hi> hand, to hurt, yea to ſlay <hi>Saul,</hi> and he was ſtrongly moved by ſome of his great Officers to doe it, yet he ſtrongly refuſed to doe it, or to ſuffer it to be done, becauſe it would have been ſin in him to doe it, himſelfe being a private perſon, and the way
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48478:120"/> in which he had any opportunity to doe it, being onely a private way, when <hi>Saul</hi> was in the Cave, covering his feet (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.3.) or in a Trench faſt aſleepe (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.7.) and therefore (though he had ſtrengthened himſelfe againſt <hi>Saul</hi> with an Army, and was ready (upon his provocation) to ſtretch forth his hand againſt him in Battell, yet) he ſaith, <hi>Who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords annoynted, and be guiltleſſe? David</hi> was not ſtopt from hurting <hi>Saul,</hi> by a rebuke from God, but by the rule and dictate of his owne conſcience. The thing might have been eaſily done, but becauſe it could not be innocently done, therefore <hi>David</hi> could not doe it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve more ſpecially to the matter of this Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A godly man (when himſelfe) cannot be harſh and greivous to others, though he have never ſo much advantage to be ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His cannings are not for ſuch uſes. What the Apoſtle ſaith of his Miniſteriall power, a gracious heart ſaith of all his power, It is <hi>for edification, not for deſtruction</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.) He deſignes his power for the helpe and comfort of all, not for the hurt or greife of any. A good man is mercifull to his Beaſt; how then can he be unmercifull to his Brethren? He pitieth a Beaſt fallen under a burthen, how then can he be cruell to his Brother when he is under burthens? Nature, or common humanity abhorrs ſuch actings; much more doth Grace. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this charge to Beleevers, <hi>Beare yee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burdens, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt (Gal.</hi> 6.2.) This Law of Chriſt is written in the heart of every man, who is Chriſts, and therefore he is farr from adding to another mans burden: He that hath a fellow-feeling of his Brethrens ſorrows, will not encreaſe their ſorrows; no man will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely encreaſe, or add to that burden which himſelfe muſt beare. <hi>Could I ſpeake as you doe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus for the Negative, what <hi>Job</hi> would not have done, if their ſoule had been in his ſoules ſtead.</p>
                  <p>But, What would he have done? He tels us in the next Verſe, this is the courſe that I would take.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here are the two parts of conſolation, and the two great duties of a comforter.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, is to ſtrengthen ſorrowfull man.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, is to abate the ſtrength of his ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> vvas reſolved upon both: Were they weake in faith, and hope, he vvould ſtrengthen them; were their feares and doubtings ſtrong, hee would endeavour to weaken them, <hi>I would ſtrengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips ſhould aſſwage your greife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Greife</hi> is not expreſſed in the Hebrew: there it is onely thus,<note place="margin">Motio labiorum meorum prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret. <hi>Heb.</hi> ſc. dolorem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum.</note> 
                     <hi>The moving of my lips ſhould aſſwage;</hi> be it what it will that greives you, I would labour to aſſwage it: I vvould aſſwage your feares, your ſorrowes, your impatience, your unbeleife; vvhatever ſpirituall evill vvere upon you, the moving of my lips ſhould be for the removing of it. Or (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers render) <hi>For the turning of it away.</hi> For the word ſignifies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To abate in degree.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To turne away, or to ſtop altogether.</p>
                  <p>My deſigne ſhould be upon both, I vvould ſtudy to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my power and parts, not onely to mitigate, but quite to remove whatſoever I ſhould finde an affliction to you.</p>
                  <p>It hath been ſhewed (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4.) what power vvords have, both to ſtrengthen vveake faith, and to aſſwage the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt greife, thither I referr the Reader; onely take two breife notes from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>A good man doth not onely abſtaine from the hurt that he might doe another, but he labours to helpe him, and to doe him good.</hi> Not to heap words in anger upon them that are in miſery,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48478:121"/> not to ſhake the head at them in contempt, is onely a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive peice of charity and kindneſſe: 'Tis our duty to uſe our utmoſt endeavour to refreſh and comfort them. Negative acts of kindneſſe are not the fulfilling of the law of love, it is not charity to the poor, to ſay I will not make them poorer, I will take nothing from them; it is our duty to give them of what we have. When a man is ſorrowfull, it is not enough to ſay, I will not increaſe his griefe; it is our duty to leſſen it, yea to turne it into joy.</p>
                  <p>And this is more conſiderable, in reference to the perſons with whom <hi>Job</hi> had to doe; they had given him very hard meaſure, yet he would not requite them with hard meaſure; he would meaſure that to them which was good, and hee would give them good meaſure. It is the common rule of humanity, to doe good to thoſe who doe us good; it is more then beaſtly, even devilliſh cruelty, to hurt thoſe that doe us good; it is the height of Chriſtianity, to doe good to thoſe who have been a hinderance to us, and to comfort thoſe who have cauſed our ſorrow. The Apoſtolicall rule is, <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to no man evill for evill (Rom.</hi> 12.17.) And againe (<hi>v.</hi> 19.) <hi>Dearely beloved, avenge not your ſelves, but rather give place unto wrath:</hi> The Apoſtle doth not meane, that we ſhould give place to our owne wrath, if we doe ſo, wee <hi>give place to the Devill,</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle intimates (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26, 27.) Our owne wrath muſt be ſtopt and reſiſted, quenched and put out. Then, what, or whoſe wrath is it, that we are commanded to give place unto? This wrath may be taken two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the wrath of that man, who is our enemy; we muſt give place to his wrath, not by approving him or his wrath, but by not anſwering him with wrath. If when another ſtorms we are calme, if when he rages, we ſhew all gentleneſſe, and meekneſſe both of ſpeech and ſpirit, then we give place to his wrath; that is, We make it roome to paſſe away and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverb is the ſumme of this Expoſition (<hi>Pro.</hi> 15.1.) <hi>A ſoft anſwer turneth away wrath, but greivous words ſtirr up anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth us not to avenge our ſelves, but <hi>rather to give place to wrath;</hi> we may underſtand it of the wrath of God; and the very next words, which the Apoſtle alleadgeth from (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35.) carry the ſenſe clearely
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48478:122"/> this way, <hi>For it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay, faith the Lord:</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſayd, if you take upon you to avenge your ſelves, you take Gods work out of his hand; it belongs to God as much to take revenge, as it doth to give reward. And therefore as a man who having done good, is over carefull and anxious how to get his reward, takes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding worke out of Gods hand, and ſhall have no more reward then he can get himſelfe; as Chriſt tels the Phariſees in that caſe (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.2.) <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, yee have your reward:</hi> And all that a man can get himſelfe, is not worth the having.</p>
                  <p>So the man, who having ſuffered wrong, goes about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelfe, takes revenging worke out of Gods hand, and ſhall be righted no further then hee can right himſelfe, which is but little, if any thing at all; whereas if he would give place to the wrath of God; that is, Let God alone, by ſuch wayes as his Juſtice ſhall raiſe up, to right him, againſt his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, he would right him fully. So that our Intereſt doth not lye in returning evill for evill, but in returning good for evill to our enemies; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> concludes (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.20.) <hi>Therefore if thine Enemy hunger, feed him, of he thirſt, give him drinke; for in ſo doing, thou ſhalt heape cooles of fire on his head.</hi> That is, thou ſhalt eyther melt and mollifie his ſpirit towards thee, as hardeſt mettals are by coales of fire (ſome ſuch mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting we may ſee in <hi>Saul</hi> towards <hi>David,</hi> when he forbore to take vengeance on him (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.21.) or thou ſhalt heape coales of divine vengeance upon him, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his malice and hatred againſt thee more inexcuſable: Which latter though it may be looked upon as a conſequent of our doing good to our Enemies, yet we muſt take heed of making it the end why we doe ſo, for that were to ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge while we forbeare it, and to doe good for that end, were <hi>to be overcome of evill;</hi> which the Apoſtle forbids in the cloſe of that Chapter.</p>

               <p>IN the five former Verſes of this Chapter, <hi>Job</hi> reproved the perſonall faylings of his Freinds towards him; hee now enters upon the confutation of their opinion. This is the conſtant method, both of <hi>Job</hi> and his Freinds; they never come to the matter till they have fallen upon the man; nor touch the opinion, till they have dealt with the perſon. And this is the tenour of moſt mens ſpirits, to this day, in diſputes and controverſies, and ſome doe not onely deale with the man before the matter, but loſe the matter in dealing with the man, entangling, and engaging themſelves ſo much in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall quarrels, that they forget, or deſert the doctrinall quarrell. <hi>Job</hi> and his Freinds, though they were too mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the former, yet they did not forget the latter, and here <hi>Job</hi> addreſſes himſelfe unto it. Yet before he enters upon the ſtate of the queſtion, he ſets forth his owne ſtate, and ſhews how it was with him; granting (which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had made the ground of his accuſation) that he was in an extreamely afflicted condition, yet denying what he from thence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he was therefore wicked, or continued knowingly in any ſinfull courſe.

                     <hi>A man may doe that for others which he cannot doe for himſelfe.</hi> He may comfort others in their ſorrows, when hee cannot comfort himſelfe, he may reſolve others in their doubts, when he cannot reſolve himſelfe, hee may anſwer to caſes which their conſciences put him, when he cannot anſwer his owne; yea 'tis poſſible for a man to ſpeak ſuch words to another, as may turne him from his ſin, and ſave his ſoule, and yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe continue in ſin, and loſe his owne ſoule for ever. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts have a rule concerning the ſenſes, That, <hi>when a ſenſible object is brought too neere, or layd upon the ſenſe, it not onely hinders, but takes away the preſent ſenſation.</hi> This holds a proportion in rationall actings: the neerer any one is to us in relation, the harder it is to fixe counſell upon him; and becauſe wee are neereſt to our ſelves, therefore it is hardeſt of all to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour Chriſt prevents what he foreſaw ſome ready to object againſt him (<hi>Luke</hi> 4.23.) <hi>Yee will ſurely ſay unto me this Proverbe, Phyſitian heale thy ſelfe.</hi> The Proverbe in its Originall is (I conceive) to be underſtood perſonally; but as Chriſt ſuggeſts it there, it is to be underſtood Nationally, or Provincially, <hi>Heale thy ſelfe,</hi> is, <hi>heale thy owne Countrey;</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thy power of working miracles there, as well as thou haſt done it in other places; that this is the meaning of it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares plainely by the next words, <hi>Whatſoever we have heard done in Canaan, doe alſo in thine owne Countrey:</hi> For Chriſt as yet had wrought no mighty workes of healing there (<hi>Mark</hi> 6.5.) But why was Chriſt ſo ſlow in manifeſting himſelfe to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48478:124"/> his owne Countreymen? Hee gives the reaſon (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 24.) <hi>And he ſayd, Verily I ſay unto you, no Prophet is accepted in his owne Countrey:</hi> The Goſpel of <hi>Mark (Chap.</hi> 6.4.) adds two cloſer relations, <hi>His owne Kin, and his owne Houſe:</hi> They in a mans houſe are neerer to him then his kindred abroad, and his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are neerer to him then his Countrey-men; now among theſe, a Prophet hath no honour: They know him ſo much, that they doe not reſpect him, or his ſayings. <hi>The Jewes ſayd, Is not this the Carpenter, the Son of Mary, the Brother of James, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt being thus neere to them, had little honour among them. Now for as much, <hi>as a man is neerer to himſelfe,</hi> not onely then his Countrey-men, but then any of his Kin; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his owne counſels and comforts have ordinarily ſo little effect upon himſelfe; he is not accepted in his owne breaſt. There are ſome indeed ſo gracious, or great in their owne eyes, that they vvill aske counſell of none but themſelves, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any adviſe but their owne; but uſually man ſeeks out, as being neither able to ſatisfie his owne doubts, nor abate his owne ſorrowes, though poſſibly, more able for both, then he to whom he ſeekes. <hi>Though I ſpeake, my griefe is not aſſwaged; and though I forbeare, what am I eaſed?</hi>

                  <p>To ſay nothing is a medicine for ſome mens ſorrow: the ſorrow of others cannot be medicin'd, but by ſaying much: A playſter of words hath cured many a wound, and the more words have been uſed, the more ſome wounds have feſtered, and the anguiſh of them hath increaſed.</p>

Where when hee would ſhew how impoſſible, or at leaſt how extreamely difficult it was to pleaſe the Jewes (they vvere a humourous people, and let a man put himſelfe in what poſture he would, they would finde ſome fault, or have ſomwhat to object againſt him) <hi>Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall I liken this generation?</hi> (they vvere ſo untoward, that Chriſt ſpeakes as if he vvere ſtraitned, how to finde out a fit compariſon for them, or could ſcarſe tell to vvhat they vvere like; yet he tells us) <hi>They are like unto Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſitting in the Markets, and calling to their fellows, ſaying, Wee have piped and yee have not danced; we have mourned to you, and yee have not lamented.</hi> When a man vvill neyther mourne vvith us, nor rejoyce vvith us, vvhat ſhall we doe vvith him? How ſhall vve pleaſe him? For vvhat company is he fit? That ſuch vvas the tendency of this ſimilitude, appeares plainely in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation vvhich Chriſt makes (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 18.) <hi>For John came neither eating, nor drinking, and they ſay he hath a Devill:</hi> They did not like the mournefull, auſtere courſe of <hi>John: The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they ſayd, Behold a man gluttonous, and a Wine-bibber, a freind of Publicans and Sinners:</hi> They did not like the free converſe of Chriſt. When a people are of this ſpirit, or at this lock, that neither a man vvho is affable and courteous, ready both to receive, and give civilities, is
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48478:125"/> welcome to them, nor yet he who is auſtere, and reſerved, cloſe, and ſtrict in his way, can give them any content, who, or what can content them? When neyther piping nor mouring, when neither dauncing nor ſorrowing takes with us, what can? When we would deſcribe a perſon whoſe troubleſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit ſeemes unanſwerable, we ſay of him, <hi>He is quiet neither full nor faſting:</hi> that is, he is never quiet, or nothing can make him quiet. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith to his Nephew <hi>Lot (Gen.</hi> 13.8, 9.) <hi>Let there be no ſtrife I pray thee, betweene me and thee, and betweene thy Herd-men and my Herd-men, for we are brethren,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will goe to the right, or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will goe to the left.</hi> Now as it is an argument of the ſweeteſt ſpirit, and fayreſt diſpoſition when a man is ready to take eyther hand, rather then breake the peace, ſo it argues the ſowreſt ſpirit, and moſt untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition, when a man will neyther goe to the right hand nor to the left, when he will neither move forward nor backward; when he will neither give nor take, neyther buy nor ſell, there is no dealing with ſuch a man, for he wav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus alſo we conclude a people incorrigible, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their ſins, whether God ſmite or heale, whether he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from, or deliver them up into the hand of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe theſe are the utmoſt bounds, or the extreames of all thoſe providentiall diſpenſations which God uſeth at any time to turne a people from their ſin.</p>

                     <hi>It is the duty, and ſhould be the care of thoſe who viſit Freinds in affliction, to pick ſomewhat out of what they ſay, or at leaſt to take occaſion from their ſilence, to adminiſter conſolation to their grieved mindes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Servants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> came to <hi>Ahab</hi> to ſue for their Maſters life; the Text ſaith (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.33.) <hi>The men did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently obſerve whether any thing would come from him</hi> (that is, whether any word of hope would come from <hi>Ahab) and they did haſtily catch it:</hi> And <hi>Ahab</hi> had no ſooner ſayd, <hi>He is my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> but they catcht at this as a word of comfort, they had what they lookt for, and ſayd, <hi>Thy Brother Benhadad.</hi> If thou owneſt him as a Brother, ſurely thou wilt not uſe him as an Enemy: There is (to the point in hand) a holy cunning in catching up words, which drop from the lips of men in affliction; and 'tis our wiſedome to make improvement of them.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance, There was an ancient Profeſſor (as I have been informed) in much diſtreſſe of conſcience, even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire; he complaining bitterly of his miſerable condition to a Freind, let this word fall, <hi>That which troubles me moſt, is, that God will be diſhonoured by my fall:</hi> This word was haſtily catcht at, and turned upon him to the aſſwaging of his griefe, <hi>Art thou carefull of the honour of God, and doeſt thou thinke God hath no care of thee, and of thy ſalvation? A ſoule for ſaken of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not what becomes of the honour of God: Therefore be of good cheere; if Gods heart were not towards thee, thine could not be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, or towards the remembrance of his name.</hi> Thus words ſhould be watcht, yea and ſilence ſhould be watcht for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to eaſe a diſtreſſed ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Theſe words may referr to God; as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, Whether I ſpeake, or whether I forbeare, God doth not come in to my helpe, I finde no comfort from him; he puts no ſtop to my paine, nor doth he aſſwage the floods of griefe which
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48478:126"/> are ready to ſwallow me up. He gives me no eaſe at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining cryes, nor doth he give me any, at my patient ſilence. The next Verſe ſeemes moſt ſutable to this expoſition, where <hi>Job</hi> applyes himſelfe to God, ſhewing what hee did to him, both while he ſpake, and while he held his peace; he wearyed him ſtill, and left him in a wearyed condition.</p>

                     <hi>Hath made me [weary]</hi> Or, <hi>He hath wearyed me;</hi> it is but one word, and it ſignifies not an ordinary wearineſſe, not ſuch a wearineſſe as comes upon us after a turne or two in the Feilds: A man who walkes into the ayre, to refreſh himſelfe, may come home weary; but it notes ſuch wearineſſe as vvee feele after long and tedious travell, or after a hard journey; yea it notes not onely wearineſſe of body, but the wearineſſe of the minde. It is poſſible for a man to weary his body, and yet his minde remaine unmoved; bare outward action ſtirres not the minde. To ride, to run, to digg, or threſh, weary the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48478:127"/> body, not the minde; but thoſe workes which with action have contention in them, as to argue, and diſpute, doe at once exerciſe and weary both minde and body.

                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>A ſtate of affliction is a weariſome eſtate.</hi> A man may be vvearyed who never ſtirrs foot from the place where he ſtands or ſits. O the vvearineſſe of a ſick bed! Suffering, vvearies more then doing; and none are ſo vveary as they who are vvearied with doing nothing.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve Secondly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some afflictions are a wearineſſe both to ſoule and body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are afflictions which ſtrike quite through; and there are afflictions which are onely skin-deep: As there is a filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſh, and a filthineſſe of the ſpirit properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (for though every ſin of the fleſh, or outward man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the ſpirit, yet there are many filthineſſes of the ſpirit, which are never acted by the fleſh, or outward man.) Thus the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) There are alſo ſome filthineſſes which ſtrike quite through fleſh and ſpirit, body and ſoule. Thus there are ſome afflictions which are meerly upon the fleſh; there are other afflictions vvhich are purely upon the ſpirit; the skin is whole, the body is in health, but the ſoule is vvounded, an Arrow ſticks vvithin: And there
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48478:128"/> are a ſort of afflictions vvhich ſtrike quite through body and ſoule; as old <hi>Simeon</hi> tells the Virgin <hi>Mary, a Sword ſhall peirce through thy ſoule (Luke</hi> 2.35.) or as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes of <hi>Joſeph (Pſal.</hi> 105.18.) according to the letter of the Hebrew, <hi>Whoſe feet they hurt with fetters, his ſoule came into Iron, or the iron entred into his ſoule:</hi> Such afflictions are like the Roll ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel (Chap.</hi> 2.) <hi>Written with lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, mourning, and woe, within and without;</hi> Some woes are vvritten onely vvithout, ſome vvoes are writen onely vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, others are written without and within. Their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters are legible upon the fleſh; and their effects deſcend and ſinke into the ſpirit. <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions were of this extenſion, he was ſmitten all over, and vvritten quite through with woes and lamentations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the word reacheth the diſtemper of the braine. Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some afflictions doe not onely afflict, but unſettle the minde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They unſettle not onely the comforts, but the powers and faculties of it: a man under ſome afflictions can ſcarſe ſpeak ſenſe vvhile he acts faith, or doe rationally while hee lives graciouſly.</p>
                  <p>A ſoule that hath grace, yea much grace, may appeare much ſcanted in the uſe of reaſon: As <hi>oppreſſion</hi> (from men) <hi>makes a wiſe man madd (Eccleſ.</hi> 7.7.) And the more wiſe a man is, the more madd it makes him: Fooles can beare oppreſſion, and not be troubled much, becauſe they doe not underſtand vvhat juſtice and right meanes; and that's the reaſon why in thoſe parts of the World vvhere Tyrants reigne, they love to keep the people ignorant, poore, and low, for ſuch are not much ſenſible of their oppreſſions; but oppreſſion is very grievous to an ingenious, vviſe, and underſtanding man, and therefore 'tis ſayd to make him madd: <hi>The pureſt intellectualls have the quickeſt ſenſe of injuries.</hi> Thus alſo ſome afflictions from the hand of God may (in a degree) make a godly wiſe man madd, and put him for a preſent plunge beyond the command of his underſtanding. It is the confeſſion of holy <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 73.22.) <hi>I was even as a beaſt beefore thee, ſo fooliſh was I and ignorant:</hi> If <hi>David</hi> a godly man acted below reaſon, when he ſaw the proſperity of the wicked; how much more may a godly man act below reaſon, under the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48478:128"/> feelings of his owne adverſity. <hi>Heman</hi> is expreſſe in this (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15.) <hi>While I ſuffer thy terrours I am diſtracted:</hi> Yet the word in the Pſalme doth not ſignifie properly the diſtraction of a man that is madd, but the diſtraction of a man that is in doubt; or the diſtraction of a man who knowes not what to doe, not of a man who knows not what he doth, &amp; yet that diſtraction doth often lead to a degree of this; for a man who is much troubled to know what to doe, and cannot know it, grows at laſt to doe he knows not what. We may alſo take in that about diſtraction ariſing from affliction, which was toucht about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction cauſed by oppreſſion: Thoſe Chriſtians, who are higheſt in ſpirituals, and have the quickeſt ſenſe of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations towards them, doe ſooneſt fall into it; whereas a ſoule upright in the maine, yet being of weake and low parts, and of ſmall experience in the things of God, will goe, yea groane under a heavy burden of affliction all his dayes, and not be much moved with it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A godly man may grow extreame weary of his afflictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Affliction is the burthen which God layes upon us, and it is our duty, not onely to beare it, but to beare it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe; yea we ſhould labour to beare it with joyfulneſſe. <hi>My brethren</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, Chap.</hi> 1.) <hi>Account it all joy when yee fall into diverſe temptations;</hi> that is, Into diverſe afflictions. But yet the beſt cannot alwayes rejoyce in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, nor tryumph under a croſſe; when affliction accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that deſcription of the word (<hi>Heb</hi> 4.12.) comes <hi>quick and powerfull, as a two edged Sword, and peirceth to divide betweene the ſoule and the ſpirit, the joynts and the marrow,</hi> when affliction (I ſay) cuts to the quick, a Beleever is put hard to it; he may be ſo farr (for a time) from tryumphing and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that he can ſcarſely finde himſelfe contented or patient; his burden may cauſe him to cry out, <hi>O, the wearineſſe!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Carnall men cry out at every burden of duty in the ſervice of God, <hi>O what a wearineſſe is it!</hi> They are tyred with an houres attendance in holy things; O the burthen! Much more doe they cry out under the lighter burdens of affliction. How tedious is a day, or an houre of affliction; two or three fits of an ague, an aking tooth, a ſoare finger, O what a wearineſſe is this! They ſinke preſently. True Beleevers, as
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48478:129"/> they have more patience in doing, ſo in ſuffering; yet even their patience doth not alwayes hold out; they, as <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeak ſometimes mournfully, and complainingly: But now, <hi>he hath made us weary.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Rather interpret it of the company he had in his owne Houſe, or for his particular Family. So it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed complaint of the loſſe of his Children and Servants, of his Freinds and Familiars, who uſed to reſort to him, and ſtay about him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou haſt made deſolate all my company:</hi> Some of <hi>Jobs</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were made deſolate; that is, they were deſtroyed; moſt of his Servants were ſlaine by the Chaldeans, and Sabeans, and all his Children were ſlaine by the fall of a Houſe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.) This company was made deſolate indeed: Yet when he ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt made deſolate all my company,</hi> his meaning is, as Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates, <hi>Thou haſt made me deſolate of all my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> that is, I am left alone.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The company of Children, and Freinds, is a very great mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heman</hi> complaines much when he wanted this mercy, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Freind haſt thou put farr from me, and mine acquaintance into darkneſſe. Job</hi> makes, as a more particular, ſo a more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall enumeration of this loſſe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 19.13, 14.) To be deſolate in ſo great an affliction, that it is often put for all afflictions; and to be deſolate of company, is the worſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48478:130"/> deſolateneſſe. When <hi>David</hi> had ſayd, <hi>I am deſolate and afflicted,</hi> he preſently adds, <hi>The ſorrowes of my heart are enlarged (Pſal.</hi> 25.16, 17.) A man may be much afflicted, and yet not deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, but a man cannot beat all deſolate, but he muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely afflicted. When the Prophet would put all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the Jewes into one word, he puts it into this (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.7.) <hi>Your Countrey is deſolate, your Land ſtrangers ſhall devoure it in your preſence:</hi> And when a Land is devoured of ſtrangers, either it is made deſolate of its owne company, or its owne company is made deſolate. <hi>Babylon</hi> boaſts (<hi>Revel.</hi> 18.7.) <hi>I ſit a Queene, and am no widdow;</hi> that is, as I have power, ſo I have reſort and company enough, I am not deſolate: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle puts theſe two together, Widdow-hood, and Deſolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.5.) <hi>Now, ſhee that is a widdow and deſolate, &amp;c.</hi> So that when <hi>Babylon</hi> ſaith, I <hi>am no widdow,</hi> her meaning is, I am not deſolate; and hence the puniſhment of <hi>Babylon</hi> is threatned in this language (<hi>Revel.</hi> 17.16.) <hi>The ten hornes which thou ſaweſt upon the Beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the Whore, and make her deſolate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe ten hornes are ten Kings, who ſometime doted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the painted beauty of that Whore, and then made frequent addreſſes to her, and did throng about her from all parts of the World; but when once their eyes ſhall be opened, their hearts will ſoone be alienated; <hi>They ſhall hate the Whore.</hi> And then as they withdraw affection, ſo viſits and meſſages; <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi> Courts ſhall be crouded with Suiters no longer: Thus they ſhall make her deſolate of the company of her old freinds, before they make her deſolate by bringing in new enemies, who ſhall ſtrip her, not onely of her company, but of her cloathes, yea of her skin; they ſhall <hi>make her naked, and eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire (Revel.</hi> 17.16.) Thus, as the miſery which came upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo the miſery which ſhall come upon <hi>Babylon</hi> meet in this, <hi>The making of their company deſolate:</hi> yet in this they differ, the deſolations of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be (at leaſt myſtically) repaired, but the deſolations of myſticall <hi>Babylon</hi> (when they are fully come upon her) ſhall be irreparable.</p>
                  <p>Man is naturally (as the Philoſopher calls him) <hi>a ſociable creature,</hi> he loves company; they who are for a ſolitary life, <hi>Monkes and Anchorets,</hi> ſeeme to have put off the nature of man.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48478:130"/> There is an elective aloneneſſe, or retyredneſſe, at ſome times very uſefull for contemplation and prayer: <hi>And we are never leſſe alone, then when we are ſo alone;</hi> for then God is more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with us, and we with him. It is ſayd of <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 32.24.) <hi>Then Jacob was left alone,</hi> not that <hi>Jacobs</hi> company had left and forſaken him, but that <hi>Jacob</hi> for a time had left his company: So, ſome render the Text actively, <hi>Hee ſtayed, or remained alone. Jacob</hi> ſtayed alone puepoſely, that hee might have freer communion with God in that receſſe and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the creature: It is good for man to be alone from the company of man, that he may enjoy (more fully) the preſence of God.</p>
                  <p>Yet God himſelfe ſayd at the firſt when man was created, <hi>It is not good for man to be alone:</hi> There was no morall evill in that aloneneſſe (for when God ſpake this word, there was no ſuch evill in the viſible World) but God called it evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo inconvenient for the civill well-being and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the naturall propagation of man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in reference to both theſe evils, God ſayd with his own mouth, <hi>It is not good for man to be alone;</hi> ſo in reference to the former of the two, God ſayd by <hi>Solomon, Two is better then one, and woe to him that is alone (Eccleſ.</hi> 4.9, 10.) <hi>Job</hi> puts his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loneneſſe among his woes, <hi>Thou haſt made deſolate all my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid, Had <hi>Job</hi> no company? Were not his Freinds about him? Did not theſe three come to mourn with him, and to comfort him? And had they not been in diſcourſe with him all this while?</p>
                  <p>Yes, he had company, but it was not ſuitable company; he had evill ones about him, as he complaines (<hi>Chap.</hi> 19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.) and though his three Freinds were good men, yet to him they were no good company, becauſe ſo unpleaſant in their converſe with him.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some company is a burthen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſay of many men, <hi>Wee had rather have their roome then their company.</hi> Man loves company, but 'tis the company of thoſe he loves. The comfort of our lives depends much upon ſociety, but more upon the ſuitableneſſe of ſociety: <hi>It is better to dwell in the corner of a houſe top, then with a brawling Woman in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48478:131"/> a wide houſe (Prov.</hi> 21.9.) And it is better to be in a Deſert among wilde Beaſts, then in a populous City among beaſtly men. This made the Prophet deſire a lodging in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (<hi>Jer.</hi> 9.2.) The Countrey about <hi>Sodome</hi> was pleaſant, like the Garden of God, yet how was the righteous ſoule of <hi>Lot</hi> vexed with the filthy and unrighteous converſation of the <hi>Sodomites?</hi> How uneaſie are our lives made to us by dwelling among either falſe Freinds or open Enemies?</p>
                  <p>In the Creation, when God ſaid, <hi>It is not good for man to be alone;</hi> he ſubjoynes, <hi>Let us make him a helpe meet for him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had all the beaſts of the earth about him, but they were no company for him, man knowes not how to converſe with beaſts, or employ his reaſon with thoſe that have none. As, <hi>it is not good for man to be alone,</hi> ſo to be in company that is not meet for him is as bad, or worſe then to be alone. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith God, <hi>Let us make him a helpe meet for him;</hi> the making of a Woman brought in meet company for mankinde; yet ſome men are as unmeet company for men as beaſts are, and are therefore in Scripture called <hi>Beaſts. Paul</hi> fought with ſuch <hi>beaſts at Epheſus;</hi> there are few places free of them, and many places are full of them. <hi>David</hi> cryes out, <hi>Woe is me that I am conſtrained to dwell in Meſech, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was company enough, but it was wofull company. The Primitive Saints aſſociated themſelves, they <hi>continued in fellowſhip one with another, as well as in the Apoſtles Doctrine, or in breaking of bread and prayer (Acts</hi> 2.42.) They were all of one minde, and were therefore f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to make one body. <hi>The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowſhip of the Saints, is the lower heaven of Saints.</hi> And the making of ſuch a company deſolate, is the ſaddeſt deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be made on earth: Communion of Saints in Heaven, is one great acceſſion to the joy of Heaven. And 'tis a great comfort to the Saints in the midſt of all the ill neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood which they meet with here, to remember that they ſhall meet with no ill neighboures there; none but Freinds there, none but loving Freinds. There ſhall not be a croſſe thought, much leſſe a croſſe word or action among thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of glorified Saints for ever, nor ſhall there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among them there but Saints: no tares in that feild, nor chaffe in that floore, no Goates in that Fold, no nor any Wolves in Sheep-skins, no prophane ones there, no nor any
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48478:131"/> Hypocrites there. Uunſutable company would render our lives miſerable in Heaven it ſelf. If God ſhould ſay to the godly and the wicked (as <hi>David</hi> once did to <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> and <hi>Ziba, Thou and Ziba divide the Land</hi>) divide Heaven among you; might they not anſwer (with reverence) as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> did to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Nay let them take it all to themſelves, O our ſoules come not into their ſecret, and unto their aſſembly let not our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be joyned: if Swearers, Adulterers, Lyers, ſhould be our company in Heaven, Heaven it ſelfe, were unheaven'd, and everlaſting life would bee an everlaſting death. And that which further argues the burdenſomneſs of unſutable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is, that even wicked men themſelves cannot but confeſs that they are burdned with the company of thoſe who are good; if ſuch come in preſence where they aſſociate in any ſinfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, how weary are they of their company? How do they even ſweat at the ſight of them? And how glad are they when ſuch turne their backs, and are gone: the onely reaſon why they like them not, is becauſe they are not like them, and they are not good company, becauſe they are good. All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is made deſolate to us, which is not made ſuitable to us. <hi>Job</hi> had many about him, yet he complaines, <hi>Thou haſt made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate all my company.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> goes on yet to deſcribe his troubles; he wanted deſireable company about him, but he had ſtore of witneſſes againſt him; he was emptyed of his comforts, but filled with ſorrowes, as might be ſeen in the ſymptomes and effects of ſorrow.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, It ſignifies, <hi>To cut off,</hi> or <hi>to cut downe (Chap.</hi> 22.15, 16.) <hi>Haſt thou marked the old way which wicked men have troden? Which were cut downe out of time:</hi> That old way was the way of ſin (the way of holineſſe is the oldeſt way, but the way of ſin is a very old way.)

                     <hi>leſt I ſhould get out, or make an eſcape, and this is a witneſſe againſt me:</hi> There is a truth in both theſe readings, as to this place; but becauſe <hi>wrinkles</hi> are more proper to the <hi>leanneſſe</hi> which followes, therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon them, but keep to our owne reading.</p>
                  <q>Thou haſt filled me with wrinkles.</q>
                  <p>Wrinckles are cauſed two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Through old age; for then the moyſture of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being conſumed, and ſo the skin contracted, wrinckles appeare: Theſe naturall wrinckles cannot be avoyded, if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hold out to old age.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are accidentall wrinckles, ſuch as are cauſed by ſtrong diſeaſes, which ſucking up, or drawing out the moyſture of the body, fade the beauty of it. Great ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes haſten on gray hayres, and make a young man looke old. <hi>Job</hi> was not filled with the wrinckles of old age (hee was in the ſtrength of nature at that time) but he was filled
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48478:132"/> with the wrinckles of ſickneſſe and ſorrow; griefe had made furrows in his face, and his teares had often filled them: we commonly ſay, <hi>Sorrow is dry;</hi> 'tis ſo, becauſe it is a dryer. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tels us, that <hi>A merry heart doth good like a medicine, but a broken ſpirit</hi> (which is the effect of much ſorrow) <hi>dryeth up the bones (Prov.</hi> 17.22.) The Church cryes out in the Book of <hi>Lamentations, My fleſh and my skin he hath made old (Lam.</hi> 3.4.) How did God make them old? He made them old not by giving them many yeares, but by giving them many troubles. Many troubles in one yeare, will make a man older then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares.</p>
                  <p>We have heard of ſome, whoſe hearts being filled with vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares have filled their heads with gray hayres in a very ſhort time. As ſome have an Art to ripen Fruits, before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ripens them; ſo the Lord hath a power to haſten old age, before nature makes us old. <hi>Thou haſt made my skin old;</hi> that is, full of wrinckles and leanneſſe; theſe are the liveries which old age gives. The Apoſtle aſſures us, that Chriſt ſhall one day preſent the Church to himſelfe, in the perfection of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall beauty and glory; that beauty and glory is deſcribed by the removall of that from her ſpirituall eſtate, which <hi>Job</hi> complaines of in his temporall eſtate: <hi>Job</hi> was full of ſpots and wrinkles, but ſhee ſhall appeare, <hi>Not having ſpot or wrinckle (Epheſ.</hi> 5.27.) that is, Without any note or marke of old age upon her. A ſpot defaceth the beauty of a Garment, and wrinckles ſpoyle the beauty of the face. An old Garment is full of ſpots, and an old face is full of wrinkles. Old things paſſe away when we are made new creatures by grace; yet in that ſtate (becauſe we are not perfectly freed from the old man) our garments have ſome ſpots, and our faces ſome wrinkles upon them: But in the ſtate of glory, when all old things, even all the image of the old <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall be totally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, we ſhall not have ſo much as one ſpot or one wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle. Beleevers have now a righteouſneſſe in Chriſt without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; they ſhall then have a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in themſelves, without <hi>ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that is, They ſhall not onely not have any ſpot or wrinkle upon them, but they ſhall have nothing like it, nothing which hath any relation to it, nothing which either themſelves or others ſhall miſtake for it, they ſhall neither ſuſpect nor be
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48478:133"/> ſuſpected to have a ſpot or a wrinkle about them. <hi>A perfect ſoule-ſtate, and a perfect ſtate of body, hath no wrinkle in it. Job</hi> to ſhew the decayes and blemiſhes of his body, ſaith hee was full of wrinkles.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Theſe wrinkles by an elegant metaphor may referr to his whole outward condition: For as a mans face is wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled when he growes old, ſo are his riches when he growes poore, and ſo is his honour when he growes out of repute. Poverty is the wrinkle of riches, and diſgrace is the wrinkle of honour; we may take in all three here, for not onely was <hi>Jobs</hi> body, but his wealth and honour were extreamely wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled, and therefore he had great cauſe to cry out according to all the the interpretations, <hi>Thou haſt filled me with wrinkles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Which witneſſe againſt me.</q>
                  <p>I ſhall give the meaning of that, when I have opened the latter clauſe, where it is repeated, <hi>My leanneſſe riſing up in me, beareth witneſſe to my face:</hi> both parts of the Verſe have the ſame meaning.</p>
                  <q>My leanneſſe riſing up in me.</q>
                  <p>Some thinke, that <hi>Job</hi> anſwers vvhat <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had given, as part of the deſcription of a vvicked man, in the fulneſſe of his proſperity (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15.27.) where he tells us, that, <hi>Hee covereth his face with fatneſſe, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>Freind Eliphaz, thou haſt told me, that wicked men are fat and full, if ſo, what are they who are leane and meagre? canſt thou according to thy owne rule, read wickedneſſe in my phyſiognomie? My leanneſſe riſeth up in me, canſt thou raiſe an argument from that againſt me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>My leanneſſe.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> body was leane, his Purſe and Name were leane, his leanneſſe and his wrinkles were of the ſame extent, both reaching all his worldly concernments. The Lord threatens Idolaters (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.11.) that <hi>he will famiſh, or make leane</hi> (ſo we put in the Margin) <hi>all their Gods. Jehovah,</hi> the true God, who ſaith to man (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.12.) <hi>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee,</hi> tels theſe falſe Gods, that hee will make them hungry: But what was the meat of theſe Gods?

                  <p>When the Jewes luſted in the Wilderneſſe, and called for fleſh to ſatisfie the fleſh: <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the Text, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.15.) <hi>gave them their requeſt, but ſent leanneſſe into their ſoule.</hi> The ſoule in a proper ſenſe, is neither fat nor leane, and therefore the ſoule in this place of the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> muſt be taken improperly, or elſe the leanneſſe of it muſt. The ſoule is put improperly for the body, or for the whole man, and ſo, <hi>he ſent leanneſſe into their ſoules,</hi> is, the curſe of God cauſed them to pine ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or <hi>he ſlew the fatteſt of them</hi> (openly) <hi>and ſmote downe the choſen men in Iſrael:</hi> So this leanneſſe is expounded (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.31.) as if he had ſayd, God made them a thin and a leane company before he had done with them. Yet beſides this (I conceive) the Text doth intend ſome ſpirituall judgement; and then the ſoule is taken in a proper ſenſe, but leanneſſe in an improper ſenſe: and ſo, <hi>he ſent leanneſſe into their ſoules,</hi> is, while they inordinately deſired meat for their bodies, God withheld the ordinary food of their ſoules: He did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter his grace and holy ſpirit (which are the fatners of the ſoule) while they were thus hungry after dainties for the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds thought him a leane ſoule, but he here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes the leanneſſe of his body; and in that his continuall ſorrow the cauſe of it. So the Prophet cryes out, <hi>My leanneſſe, my leanneſſe, woe unto me (Iſa.</hi> 24.16.)</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Though, when a man is leane, his fleſh falls, yet his bones riſe: A fat mans bones are (as it were) buried in fleſh, you can ſcaſe feele his ribs, but when he growes leane, his bones ſtick out, and riſe up: That is the meaning here, <hi>my leanneſſe riſing up.</hi>

                  <p>But <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds ſaid, theſe were vvitneſſes of his ſin: they produced the wrinkles of his body as a vvitneſſe of his vvrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled ſoule; and the leanneſſe of his outward man, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his inward leanneſſe; they ſayd, theſe teſtified plainely, that he was not onely a great ſinner, but an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite:

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Great afflictions leave their marks behinde them.</hi>

                  <p>Little afflictions leave no wrinkles, no leanneſſe behinde them, vve recover out of them, and nothing appeares of them; as it is in ſinning, ſome ſins leave no mark, ſuch are our daily infirmities, and common failings; but there are other ſins, which leave a mark behinde them, you cannot get them off ſuddenly, it may be you cannot claw off the marks of ſome ſins as long as you live: though the ſin be fully pardoned, yet the mark, the vvrinkle, the leanneſſe of it may remaine to your dying day. <hi>David</hi> being defiled with adultery and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, prayes, <hi>Cauſe the bones which thou haſt broken to rejoyce:</hi> Thoſe two vvere ſuch ſins as broke his very bones; they vvere to his ſoule, as the breaking of a bone is to the body: If a man break a bone, though it be vvell Set, yet it leaves a mark. <hi>David</hi> carryed the skarr of thoſe ſins to his Grave: Though God had forgiven thoſe ſins, and did not remember them, to impute them to <hi>David,</hi> yet when God had occaſion to ſpeake of <hi>David</hi> to his higheſt commendation, he could not forbeare the mention of thoſe ſins (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5.) <hi>David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aſide from any thing that he commanded him all the dayes of his life, ſave onely in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> The vvrinkle or ſtaine of that ſin ſtuck upon <hi>Davids</hi> reputation, when the guilt of it vvas quite removed, and vvaſhed off from his perſon. 'Tis ſo with afflictions, ſome afflictions leave no mark, others goe deep: Though all afflictions are light comparatively to the weight of glory, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>For our light affliction which is but for a moment, workes for us a farr more exceeding, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of glory:</hi> Yet afflictions being compared among themſelves, ſome are light, and ſome are heavy: As a Cart that is heavy laden, cuts deep into the earth, and tells you where it hath gone; ſo doth the vvheele of a heavy affliction drawne over body, ſoule, or ſtate.</p>

                  <p>We no ſooner heare of, or ſee a man under great afflictions, but our firſt thought is ſurely he hath committed ſome great ſin.

                  <p>Take heed of paſſing judgement upon the evidence of ſuch vvitneſſes as theſe, wrinkles, and leanneſſe; for though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vvrinkle vvitneſſe that a man is a ſinner (were it not for ſin we ſhould have remained ever in our body and outward condition, as Beleevers ſhall be reſtored by Chriſt, without a wrinkle) yet they are not vvitneſſes that a man is wicked: I may ſay two things of theſe vvitneſſes.</p>

                  <p>It is a very queſtionable and uncertaine evidence which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions give againſt us: <hi>For no man knowes love, or hatred, by all that is before him:</hi> We can but gueſſe at the beſt, by vvhat they ſay.<note place="margin">Rugae meae te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonium di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt contra me, &amp; ſuſcitatur falſiloquus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus faciem meam contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens mihi. <hi>Vulg.</hi>

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48478:135"/> Yea if we make affliction a witneſſe, we may rather make it a witneſſe of ſincerity, and of grace, a marke of adoption and ſonſhip, a mark of divine Favour and Fatherly love, then of mans wickedneſſe, or of Gods rejection and disfavour. The word is cleere and expreſſe for this (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8.) <hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But if yee be without chaſtiſement whereof all are partakers, then are yee Baſtards and not Sons.</hi> So then, our wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles and our leanneſſe may upon Scripture warrant, be brought as witneſſes for us, but we have no warrant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon their witneſſe, either againſt our ſelves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeemes <hi>Job</hi> had a higher witneſſe againſt him (if ſuch witneſſes might be allowed) then a wrinkled skin, or a leane face: Behold now his torne fleſh, and his limbs rent in ſunder, as if (not onely like <hi>Daniel</hi>) he had been caſt into a Lyons Den, but as if (which <hi>Daniel</hi> did not) he had felt the worſt of the Lyons teeth and pawes.</p>

Was it a griefe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion at the miſery of others?

                  <p>Fourthly, Gnaſhing of teeth is an argument of extreame wrath and anger (<hi>Acts</hi> 7.54.) where it is ſayd of <hi>Steevens</hi> at once Auditors and Enemies, <hi>When they heard thoſe things, they were cut to the heart (Peters</hi> Auditors, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. were prickt at the heart with godly ſorrow, <hi>Stevens</hi> Auditors were cut to the heart with ungodly anger) <hi>and they gnaſhed upon him with their teeth.</hi> The gnaſhing of teeth here ſpoken of is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commitant of ſuppoſed wrath, <hi>He teareth me in his wrath, and gnaſheth upon me with his teeth.</hi>

                  <p>What literall ſmiting is, all know, and moſt have felt, but had <hi>Job</hi> any about him who uſed him thus rudely? I conceive, not; and therefore we may underſtand him metaphorically. So, ſmiting on the cheek, is to reproach: And theſe words, <hi>They have ſmitten me on the cheek reproachfully,</hi> are no more nor leſſe, then, <hi>They have reproached me.</hi> To ſmite on the cheek, is a thing ſo reproachfull, that, by an Hebraiſme,<note place="margin">Percutere maxillam He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braica locutio eſt, quae ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat graviſſima contumelia ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem afficere.</note> it ſignifieth to reproach (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.30.) <hi>He giveth his cheek to him that ſmiteth him,</hi> which is expounded in the latter clauſe by this, <hi>he is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led full with reproach.</hi> The ſufferings of Chriſt, which were full of reproach, are thus Propheſied, <hi>I gave my back to the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the haire: I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting (Iſa.</hi> 50.6.) Chriſt was ſmitten on the face literally (<hi>Matth.</hi> 26.67.) <hi>Then did they ſpit in his face and buffeted him, and others ſmote him with the palmes of their hands.</hi> Hee was ſmitten alſo tropically, being put to open ſhame, and diſgracefully dealt with. That of the Apoſtle
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48478:139"/> cleares this ſenſe (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20.) <hi>Yee ſuffer a man to bring you into bondage, if a man devoure you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himſelfe, if a man ſmite you on the face,</hi> that is, If he diſgrace you: So the Apoſtle expounds it (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 21.) <hi>I ſpeake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning reproach. Paul (Chap.</hi> 12.) had a meſſenger of Satan ſent to buffet him, to cuffe, or ſmite him with the fiſt, ſo the word ſignifies; what that was, at leaſt in part, hee explaines (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>I will therefore take pleaſure in reproaches.</hi> Thus the Prophet deſcribes the diſhonour which ſhould be put upon the Judge (<hi>Micah.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>Now gather thy ſelfe in Troops, O daughter of Troops, he hath layd ſeige againſt us; they ſhall ſmite the Judge of Iſrael with a rod upon the cheek,</hi> that is, The Enemy ſhall powre contempt upon thy Kings and Princes;<note place="margin">Cum aliquis propter gravem aliquam igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniam pudefit, licet vis omnis abſit, &amp; plaga verberari dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in maxilla. <hi>Sanct. in Mic. c. 5. v. 1.</hi>
                     </note> in which ſenſe they may be ſayd to be ſmitten upon the cheek, though no rod nor hand touch them. And ſome interpret that (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.39.) <hi>If any man ſmite thee on the right cheeke, turne to him the left alſo,</hi> not of hand, but tongue ſmiting, or of ſuffering reproach. As if Chriſt had ſayd, <hi>If any one diſgrace thee a little, beare it, yea though he ſhould diſgrace thee a great deale more, yet beare it:</hi> Smiting upon the right cheek, notes a leſſer injury received. When a man ſmites another on the right cheek, he ſmites with his left hand; the left hand ſtrikes the right cheek, and the left hand is the weaker in moſt, and gives a weaker blow. If thou receive a blow on thy right cheek with the left hand, turne the other, and let him ſmite thee with the right hand, let him give thee a ſmarter, a hander blow: that is, If a man diſgrace thee a little, reward him not with diſgrace, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to beare a greater, turne the left cheek. And the reaſon of this was, becauſe ſlaves and condemned perſons were thus ſmitten, as alſo ſuch as were ſuppoſed to ſpeake irreverently to the Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Hence it was that when <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpoken freely to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, ſaying, <hi>Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conſcience before God untill this day:</hi> preſently <hi>Ananias</hi> the high Prieſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe that ſtood by him to ſmite him on the mouth (<hi>Acts</hi> 23.1, 2.) In which caſe Chriſt himſelfe was ſmitten by an Officer that ſtood by (<hi>John</hi> 18.22.) From all which Scripture teſtimonies it is more then manifeſt, that to ſmite a man on the cheek, is to diſgrace, becauſe they who fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſgrace, were uſually ſmitten on the cheek: and this I
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48478:139"/> take to be the moſt ſuitable interpretation of <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint in this place, <hi>They ſmite me on the cheek reproachfully.</hi>

                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>

The word of God was made a reproach to the Prophet <hi>Jeremy (Chap.</hi> 20.8.) And the ſpirit was made a reproach to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.13.) <hi>Others mocked, ſaying, Theſe men are full of new Wine: When indeed they were filled with the holy Ghoſt (Verſ.</hi> 4.)

                  <p>We are fools, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> (that is, We are ſo called and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) for Chriſt, and being <hi>defamed</hi> (or as the word bears, <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed,</hi> to ſpeake againſt any thing of God in Man, is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, as well as ſpeaking directly againſt God) <hi>we entreat.</hi> And to ſhew, that this was no prick with a Pin, or ſmall ſcratch upon their credit, which made him complaine; hee tels us what this fame did amount unto, <hi>We are made as the filth of the World, and as the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 13.)</p>

                  <p>How <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and other Reformers of the former age, were ſmitten reproachfully, both by the tongues and Pens of the Popiſh Party, is knowne of all theſe parts of the World: And how much this trade (which is indeed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils trade) of ſlandering the footſteps of Gods annoynted ones, is continued unto this day, we have but too much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. A man can ſcarſe appeare, indeed, for God, but he is thus ſmitten on the cheek by men. Religion and the power of godlineſſe have ever been an occaſion of contention, and for the moſt part, to ſmite with reproach, hath been the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of contending.</p>
                  <p>There are not many enemies of good men, who have a Sword to draw againſt them, but all the Enemies of good men have ill words enow at command to throwe againſt them, and of them they are ſeldome ſparing: And, though (which is bad enough, yet no better can be expected of them) this trade of reproaching be driven moſt by evill men againſt thoſe who are good, yet (which is farre worſe) wee may learne from this inſtance betweene <hi>Job</hi> and his Freinds (for even they did not ſpare to reproach him) that (which ſhall be,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A good man may ſo farr forget himſelfe, as to ſpeake reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt his Brother:</hi> Yea, the reproaches of Profeſſors one againſt another, have been (as they are the ſaddeſt, ſo) the ſharpeſt and bittereſt reproaches. They who agree in moſt things, take it moſt unkindely when they differ in any thing; and are more ready to revile one another about the points wherein they differ, then to bleſſe God for thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are agreed. The Papiſts did not more reproach <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> whoſe judgements concurred in oppoſing them,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48478:140"/> then <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> have reproached each other, where they are oppoſite in judgement: The corrupt remaines even in good men, tell them that whoſoever differs from them ſtands in their light and obſcures their excellency, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that themſelves may ſhine the brighter in what they hold, they little care (when maſter'd by ſelfe and paſſion) how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, yea foule they render them, who hold the contrary.</p>
                  <p>While Infidels reproached Chriſtians, it was the glory of Chriſtianity, and while the wicked reproach the godly, it is the glory of godlineſſe; but while one Chriſtian reproaches another, the glory is departed from godlineſſe. Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that the Servants of God are thus ſmitten by the world, muſt they needs ſmits their fellow-Servants, and revile thoſe who are (upon the maine) in the ſame way of God wherein they are, onely becauſe they are not fully in their way? Yea, when poſſibly, they may be in a higher and more perfect way then they? Is it not enough that the Bryars and Thornes, which are among the Lillyes, teare and ſcratch them? Shall the Lillyes degenerate into Bryars and Thornes one towards another? Or if at any time a Lilly of the one ſide teare, and be harſh, ſhould not the Lilly on the other ſide be kinde and gentle?

A Sword wounds at hand, and ſmites thoſe that are neere; an Arrow wounds afarr off: So that whether a man be farr off, or neer, whether his error be ſmall or great, or but imaginary; it is all one to a reproachfull ſpirit, his tongue ſerves him for all turnes: <hi>David</hi> was tryed by all manner of reproaches; but thoſe which pinched and preſſed him moſt, were his reproaches about ſpirituall things. Any reproach is bad enough, but a reproach in Religion, is worſt; to be reproached with our prayers, and with our God, <hi>Where is your God?</hi> Such reproaches, how deep doe they goe? They ſtrike to the very heart. <hi>Credit is a precious commodity;</hi> a man is more tender of it, then of his fleſh; now all reproach falls upon our credit, and the more excellent that peece of our credit is, upon which the reproach fals, the more greivous is that reproach to us. Credit in ſpirituall things is the moſt excellent credit: Thus <hi>David</hi> was reproached, and ſo was <hi>Job, Is this thy feare, and thy confidence?</hi> Is this the thing thou haſt ſo long boaſted of? Chriſt was to beare the greateſt burden of affliction, and therefore he did not onely beare the Croſſe, but reproach with it; he ſuffered death, and reproach with death; he ſuffered the ſhamefull death of the Croſſe, in which there was more then a reproach, a curſe, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree:</hi> Chriſt muſt dye an ignominious death, as well as a painefull, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny was a heavier burden then the paine. Wee are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.13.) <hi>To goe out bearing his reproach;</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that to beare the reproach of Chriſt, would be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to us, and a ſtronger temptation, then to beare the croſſe of Chriſt. As the greateſt part of Chriſts ſufferings for us, was to beare our reproach, ſo the greateſt part of our ſufferings for Chriſt is to beare Chriſts reproach: <hi>Let us goe forth unto him without the Camp, bearing his reproach.</hi> And indeed reproach is ſo great a burden, that were not this conſideration in it;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48478:141"/> that is, Chriſts, no man would bear it; and they will yeeld to doe any thing rather then ſuffer reproach, who are not able to ſay that their reproach is the reproach of Chriſt. <hi>Moſes</hi> looked upon his reproach, as <hi>the reproach of Chriſt,</hi> he did not eſteeme his owne reproach, but the reproach of Chriſt greater riches, then the treaſures of Aegypt (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26.) Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is nothing but dung or droſſe which hath weight in it to preſſe us, but no worth in it to enrich us; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt is treaſure, which though it have weight in it to preſſe us, yet it hath abundance of worth in it to enrich and crowne us. The Apoſtle cals it, The reproach of Chriſt, both becauſe Chriſt did beare ſuch reproach himſelfe, and becauſe Chriſt owned <hi>Moſes</hi> in bearing that reproach; yea he owned that reproach which <hi>Moſes</hi> bare, as if he had borne it himſelfe; while we are reproached for Chriſts ſake, Chriſt is reproached; and though it ſhould grieve us that Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached in us, yet it may comfort us, that Chriſt takes our reproach as his. <hi>They have ſmitten me on the cheek reproachfully,</hi> and yet they have not done with me.</p>

                  <p>The word that we tranſlate to <hi>gather together,</hi> hath a ſecond ſignification, namely, to fill, either as a roome is filled with Goods, or Perſons, or as the ſtomack is filled with meat,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, Pleaſure in the ſufferings and ſorrows of others; ſome doe not onely put others to the ſuffering of ſorrow, but take pleaſure in the ſorrow which they ſuffer; they make their teares as Wine, their aſhes as Bread; and untill they ſee
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48478:142"/> them weeping and feeding on aſhes, their owne Wine is as teares, and their Bread as aſhes to them. <hi>Haman</hi> came full from the Queenes Banquet, and he was invited by her to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Banquet the next day, yet ſtill he was hungry, and ſayd (<hi>Heſt.</hi> 5.13.) <hi>All this avayleth me nothing, ſo long as I ſee Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai the Jew ſitting at the Kings gate:</hi> 'Tis like, <hi>Haman</hi> had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and drunke freely, yet the Banquet had not filled his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>All this availeth me nothing. More then forty of the Jewes bound themſelves under a curſe, that they would neyther eate nor drink till they had killed Paul (Acts</hi> 23.12, 13.) It would have been better to <hi>Haman</hi> then meate and drinke to have killed <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai,</hi> and all the Jewes.</p>
                  <p>Some have been heard to ſay, <hi>O how ſweet is revenge!</hi> What a pleaſant draught is a draught of blood! Spightfull ſpirits hunger and thirſt for the downefall and miſery of thoſe who ſtand in their way; nor will any thing ſatisfie hatred, but the ruine of thoſe who are hated; and when once they ſee them ruined, they are ſatisfied; as envy is troubled at the good which another enjoyes more then at all the evils which it ſelfe feeles; ſo malice is more ſatisfied with the evils which befall others, then with all the good which it ſelfe enjoyes (<hi>Ex.</hi> 15.9.) <hi>The enemy ſayd, I wil purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoyle, my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them. Pharoah</hi> and his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, yea all the Aegyptians hungred and thirſted for the fleſh and blood of Iſrael: They had a luſt, or a longing rather (as women with Childe have ſometimes inordinate appetites af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrange meates) to eate mans fleſh, and drink the blood of the ſlain: Revenge is as craving a luſt as covetouſneſſe, but it is a luſt more eaſily ſatisfied then covetouſneſſe. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes by receiving what it deſires, but that (if it may have it) is ſatisfied: That which covetouſneſſe receives, is onely as fewell to a fire, but that which revenge receives,<note place="margin">Appetitus finis eſt infinitus.</note> is as food to the ſtomack; the deſire of the end is infinite, but the end being once attained, deſire is at an end: <hi>Yee are filled with mee.</hi>

As they know no meaſure in ſinning againſt God, ſo they keep none in vexing man. The Lord promiſeth (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.3.) <hi>The Rod of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righteous;</hi> implying, that by the good will of evill men it ſhould reſt there; they would never take it off, if God did not.</p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:48478:144"/>
                  <p>Secondly (which troubles more then the former) Their blaſph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>my. And that firſt againſt God himſelfe, as if he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not deliver out of their hands (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32, 14.) What is your God that he ſhould be able to deliver you out of my hand (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.) <hi>Where is now their God?</hi> Thus the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Jewes into whoſe hand God delivered his Son, did even dare <hi>God</hi> to come to his reſcue (<hi>Mat.</hi> 27.43.) or, as if he took their part, and favoured the cauſe which they have in hand. Secondly, They blaſpheame, or ſpeak evill both of the wayes and people of God. What's become of your prayers now? Where's your faſting now? Of which you boaſted, that it would doe ſuch wonders. It is a ſoare affliction to be under the rule of wicked men, much more to be under their rage: that prophetick curſe which <hi>David</hi> denounceth againſt his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, is thus expreſſed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.6.) <hi>Set thou a wicked man over him:</hi> A wicked man were better be under the power of good men, then of the wicked (for a good man cannot be ſo ſevere to a wicked man, as one wicked man is to another) but if a wicked man be ſo cruell to wicked men who are ſo like him, how cruell muſt he needs be to godly men who are altogether unlike him?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Godly men looke through all ſecond cauſes to the firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As they reſt not in the creature for the good which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſo they ſtay not in the creature when they receive evill; they ſee a hand of God in and over all.</p>
                  <p>Note Fifthly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We glorifie God as much in acknowledging afflictions, as in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging mercies and bleſſings to come from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is the Author of both; he takes it as much upon him, that he <hi>creates darkneſſe, as that he formes light;</hi> that is, As the next words expound it, <hi>That hee creates evill as well as makes peace (Iſa.</hi> 45.7.) Now if the Lord challenges this as a part of that glory which he will not give to Idols, then, we give him the glory of the onely true God, while wee acknowledge this.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no way to ſettle or quiet the heart till it looke up to God as the diſpoſer of our troubles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Jobs</hi> laſt reſort: And this was <hi>Davids</hi> when <hi>Shimei</hi>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:48478:144"/> curſed him, <hi>God hath bid Shimei curſe:</hi> This kept downe thoſe angry motions, which muſt elſe have boyled up as high in his ſpirit, as they did in <hi>Abiſhaes,</hi> himſelfe being more deeply concerned in it then <hi>Abiſhai</hi> was. <hi>Job</hi> having diſcovered this frame of ſpirit more then once before, I here onely touch upon it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Take this comfortable Corolary from the whole.</p>
                  <p>Though God doth often deliver his choyceſt Servants into the power of wicked men, yet he never delivers them up to the will of wicked men: They cannot doe with his people what they pleaſe, they ſhall onely doe what God himſelfe pleaſeth, though they diſpleaſe God highly in doing it. God never turnes the leaſt of thoſe who beleeve in his Name, out of his owne hand, though he turne them over into the hand of the ungodly: as God keeps his title to them ſtill, ſo hee ſtill keepes the poſſeſſion of them. Saints in the hand of the vileſt men, are in the hand, or poſſeſſion of God two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are in the hand of his power, he can fetch them out of the hands of men when he will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are under the hand of his care; and this five wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To provide, that though they endure much hardſhip in their hands, yet they ſhall receive no hurt; God doth not turn his into the hands of evill men for evill, but for good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He hath them in the hand of his care to furniſh them with ſtrength to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To teach them how to profit by ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To moderate the hands of the wicked towards them, their hands ſhall not be heavier then he hath appointed, they ſhall not give you a ſtroak more then hee hath numbred out.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As to order how much, ſo likewiſe how long they ſhall ſuffer: Our times are in Gods hand, when we are in the hand of men. As they cannot add a drop to our cup, ſo not a Sand to our Glaſſe, beyond what the Lord hath appointed out.</p>

                  <hi>JOB</hi> ſtill proſecutes the ſame argument, ſetting out his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in their darkeſt colours to the ſeventeenth Verſe of this Chapter, and then with higheſt confidence atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, yea calling Heaven and Earth to atteſt both the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of his wayes towards men, and the rightneſſe of his worſhip tendered unto God.</p>
               <p>Theſe three, with the two Verſes following, containe two generall points.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He tels us how, and in what manner he was handled by God in thoſe dayes of his affliction, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He tels us how he behaved himſelfe under the hand of God, or how he was affected with theſe afflictions, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15, 16.

               </p>
               <p>He begins with, or rather proſecutes the deſcription (for he had ſpoken much of it before) of his ſad afflictions. And becauſe contraries illuſtrate, and ſet forth one another, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he firſt ſhewes what condition he had been in: ſecondly, what he then was in. <hi>Our preſent wants and evills are aggravated by our former comforts and enjoyments.</hi>

                  <p>But how doth this agree with what <hi>Job</hi> affirmed (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48478:145"/> 26.) <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I reſt, neither was I quiet, yet trouble came.</hi> It ſeemes <hi>Job</hi> was never at eaſe, and yet he ſaith here, <hi>I was at eaſe:</hi> He that is not in ſafety, and hath neither reſt nor quiet, ſurely, <hi>He is in little eaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no contradiction between theſe two, we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconcile them, and make up the ſeeming difference, thus. When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.) <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I reſt, neither was I quiet;</hi> his meaning is, that his ſpirit did not truſt upon his outward proſperity: He had abundance in the World, but he had no carnall confidence in worldly things. <hi>Job</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſayd to his ſoule (when his Barnes were full, and his ſubſtance multiplyed) <hi>Soule take thy eaſe, eate and be merry, thou haſt enough layd up for many years. Job</hi> had much of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his hand, but he kept it all out of his heart, and when he was furtheſt from miſery, he was farr enough from ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; he did not thinke his life ſafe, becauſe he had ſufficient to live upon, nor was he at reſt, becauſe he was rich. A Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers reſt is not in any outward comfort which he receives from God, but in God, from whom he receives all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. So then, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes there of the ſpirituall frame of his heart, but here he ſpeakes of the temporall frame of his worldly eſtate, in which he had eaſe, and the affluence of all good things, no man moleſting him: As if he had ſayd, <hi>Time was when I was not at all pinched with poverty in my eſtate, nor bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with reproach in my credit, nor tortured with paines in my body; I can remember the time when I was at full eaſe in all theſe:</hi> That's his ſenſe in this Text, and between theſe two there is no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: <hi>A man may be at eaſe in the World, and yet not make the World his eaſe, nor reſt upon the World.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe riches and eaſe uſually goe together; and unleſſe a man live at eaſe, that is, in outward peace, it is hard to gather riches. <hi>Times of Warre and trouble are ſcattering and impoveriſhing times: The rowling Stone gets no Moſſe.</hi> As men have the beſt opportunity, ſo they are moſt active to gather wealth

                  <p>Secondly, The ſame word ſignifies, both to be rich, and to be at eaſe, from the effect; becauſe, men that are rich, uſually take their eaſe; as eaſe and peace give them opportunity to gather riches, ſo riches cauſe them to take their eaſe, both outward civill eaſe, and oft times inward ſinfull eaſe; that is, to ſit downe, and make their riches, and outward accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, the very baſis of their quiet and contentment.

                  <p>It is an affliction, never to have been in proſperity; but it is a greater affliction to be caſt downe from a ſtate of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for him that hath been great, and rich, and powerfull in the World, to become meane, and poore, and powerleſſe,<note place="margin">Cor dolet, quam ſcio nunc, ut ſum atque ut fut. <hi>Plaut. in Moſtel.</hi> Cernite ſim qualis, qui mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do talis eram. <hi>Ovid.</hi> Fuimus Troes et.</note> this pinches ſoare, and goes to the quick. <hi>Job</hi> aggravates his ſorrows at large upon this account (<hi>Chap.</hi> 29. <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.) <hi>The Candle of God ſhined upon my head, I waſhed my ſteps in butter, my glory was freſh in me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But now they that are younger then I have me in deriſion,</hi> &amp;c.

Every remembrance of the Wormewood and the Gall of their preſent affliction in <hi>Babylon,</hi> was made more bitter by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Milke and Honney which flowed in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> They who have alwayes been in a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſcarſe feele or know the want of great things, becauſe they never knew the meaning of their enjoyment.</p>

                  <p>As a downefall from a ſeeming height in ſpirituals into the mire of ſin, hath more wickedneſſe in it then a bare continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſin; ſo a downefall from a reall hight in temporals into the mire of miſery, hath more trouble in it, then a bare continuance in miſery. They who have made a fayre ſhew, or an outward flouriſh in the Faith, and afterward fall back, are worſe then thoſe who never made any ſhew at all. It is ſad for any one to live openly in ſin; but for ſuch as have made an open profeſſion of godlineſſe, to apoſtatize, and fall back to ſin, this is matter of ſaddeſt lamentation: For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>It had been better for them that they had not knowne the way of God, then after they have knowne it to turne from the holy Commandement:</hi> It is better (in ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) never to have been a Profeſſor, then to be an Apoſtate. Thus alſo it is better (in civill reſpects) never to have been high, or great in the World, then after all this to ſuffer a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable downfall, and to be numbred among the loweſt of the People.</p>
                  <p>And in this we may ſee the wonderfull love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to poore ſinners, who ſuffered ſo great a change for our ſakes; he might well ſay, <hi>I was at eaſe, but hee hath broken me aſunder.</hi> Chriſt was broken all to peices for us, hee was broken and bruiſed for us, but he had been at eaſe: How great was his love vvho vvillingly ſuffered, not onely for ſinners, but as a ſinner, having reigned in righteouſneſſe from all eternity? The Apoſtle uſeth this argument, more then once, to advance the kindneſſe of Chriſt to ſinfull man (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 9.) Beloved, <hi>You know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who though he were rich, yet he became poore for our ſakes;</hi> that <hi>we through his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might be made rich:</hi> For Chriſt vvho vvas rich to become poore, argues the riches of his love; this ſhewes the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he bare to us, becauſe it ſhewes that he bare ſuch great affliction for us.</p>
                  <p>Againe (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7.) <hi>Who being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall wioh God; but made himſelfe of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. and tooke upon him the forme of a Servant:</hi> He emptyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48478:147"/> to fill us, and to raiſe our reputation vvith his Father, layd downe his owne.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſuffered ſuch a vvondrous change, from the forme of God to the forme of a Servant, from the fulneſſe of God, to the emptineſſe of the meaneſt man; this is the higheſt teſtimony of his love. The courſe vvhich Chriſt did run to ſave us, declares that there went as much of his love, as of his worthineſſe to ſave us: For as no creature had worth enough to ſave us any way, ſo no creature had love enough to ſave us in ſuch a vvay. If one had come out of poverty and miſery to dye for us, it had ſhewed vvonderfull love, but to leave riches and become poore, to leave glory and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come baſe, to leave fulneſſe and become empty, to leave (in regard of viſible manifeſtations) his God-head, and become Man: How unchangeable was his heart to us, who yeelded himſelfe up to ſuch changes for us? He being at eaſe was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken aſunder that we might not be broken, or rath r that vve might be made vvhole for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I was at eaſe:</hi> What follows? <hi>He hath broken me aſunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All worldly proſperity may quickly be daſht and loſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>As thus the whole World paſſeth awy, ſo doth the ſtate of each man in the World. And as there is in the World an affected varying of faſhions, or a voluntary paſſing from one vaine faſhion to another, from one proud faſhion to another; ſo there is an inflicted variety of faſhion in the World; God makes man paſſe from one faſhion to another, whether he will or no, or much againſt his will; when his faſhion was fulneſſe, he makes it emptineſſe, when his faſhion was riches, he makes it poverty; when his faſhion was Peace and quietneſſe, hee makes it Warr and confuſion; theſe are the changes which God makes among the faſhions of the World. The pride of man changes from one vaine faſhion to another; the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God changes man from his moſt delightfull, to a mournfull faſhion: And when the Garments of outward proſperity ſeem to us ſo ſtrong, that they will never vveare out, how much or how long ſo ever we weare them, hee teares and breaks both them and us, as <hi>Job</hi> complaines with his next breath.</p>

                     </note>This ſentence is but one word in the Hebrew, yet more then a ſingle word; it is elegantly doubled in conſtruction to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply double affliction. <hi>Grammarians</hi> tell us, that two words put together, or the ſame word twice put encreaſe the ſenſe. Ordinary words will not ſerve to expreſſe an extraordinary condition; he ſpeakes great and compounded words, becauſe his ſorrows were great and compounded ſorrows. <hi>Jobs</hi> was not a ſingle, but a double breaking; yea, his vvas a manifold breaking: He vvas often broken, and utterly broken; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſtroaks which fell upon him (by divine diſpenſation) from all hands, had beaten him to duſt and atomes: <hi>He hath broken me in ſunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, The <hi>root</hi> of the vvord ſignifies, <hi>to make voyd,</hi> to diſſipate, to ſcatter, to bring to nought, or to make nothing of (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.10.) <hi>The Lord brings to nought the counſell of the heathen.</hi> So againe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.10.) It is uſed often for breaking the Law, by frequent and vvilfull ſinning againſt it. Proud
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48478:148"/> ſinners vvould break the Law in ſunder, or pull it all in pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: <hi>They have made voyd thy Law (Pſa.</hi> 119) As if they would not onely ſin againſt the Law, but ſin away the Law, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vvithdraw themſelves from the obedience of it, but drive it out of the World; they would make voyd and repeale the holy acts of God, that their owne wicked acts might not be queſtioned; and leſt the Law ſhould have a power to puniſh them, they vvill deny it a power to rule them; that's the force of the ſimple vvord here uſed, as applyed to higheſt tranſgreſſing againſt the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Now as vvicked men by ſinning, vvould batter the Law to peices, ſo God by afflicting doth ſometimes break good men to peices. Conſider what courſe uſage the holy Law of God hath in the hearts and lives of vvicked men; O how they tear it and vex it, and batter it every day: Thus doth the Lord deal vvith many of his holy ſervants vvho (had they their vviſh) would not make the leaſt breach in the Law, and vvhoſe hearts are often broken vvith godly ſorrow, becauſe they cannot but break it, yet to theſe he doth not onely give a bruiſe or a blow but breaks them aſunder.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another elegancy in the ſignification of the vvord: For as Hebreicians obſerve, it notes a bruiſing, like that of Grapes, or Olives, vvhich are trodden in a preſſe, to make Wine or Oyle;<note place="margin">Confractus ſum velut uvae aut olivae in torcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari.</note> hence alſo a <hi>Noune</hi> from this <hi>Verbe</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Wine-preſſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3.) Now Grapes and Olives being trodden, are broken and bruiſed in peices; not onely is their forme and beauty totally ſpoyled, but all their ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, juyce, and liquor, is vvrought out of them, and they are left as a dry lumpe.</p>
                  <p>Now look vvhat Grapes and Olives are, vvhen taken out of the Preſſe; even ſuch a lumpe vvas <hi>Job;</hi> he vvas broken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder in the Wine-preſſe, though not of Gods vvrath, as his Freinds mis-judged, yet in the Wine-preſſe of his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſevereſt tryalls; all his vvorldly moyſture vvas ſqueezed out, and his earthly glory vvas quite defaced, he had nothing left of that, but (as it were) a dry huske; yet his ſpirituall eſtate was ſtill juicy, and his ſoule by theſe preſſings, treadings, and breakings, had diſtilled much ſweet Oyle and Wine, and much more was ſtill remaining in him.

                     <hi>God doth not onely afflict thoſe whom he loves, but afflict them ſoarely and ſeverely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He afflicts ſome, not onely to the empayring and abating, but to the undoing and ruining of their outward comforts, and worldly enjoyments: Nothing can be ſayd to deſcipher an afflicted ſtate beyond what this word will beare. And that God doth afflict his choſen ones to the utmoſt rack of this phraſe, will appeare alſo from all that follows to the end of the fourteenth Verſe; the opening of which will be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall proofe and illuſtration of this great and often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented truth, upon, and among the precious Sons of Sion: This I ſhall hint all along, beſides thoſe obſervations which ariſe out of them: <hi>He hath broken me aſunder,</hi> and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, in the ſame Verſe;
<q>He hath alſo taken me by my neck, and ſhaken me to peices.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this to deale ſeverely? A loving Father takes his Son about the neck and kiſſes him; what a rough ſalute did the Lord give this Son of his, when he tooke him by the neck, and ſhook him to peices? Such a carriage ſeemes not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men, much leſſe after the manner of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet this was the manner of God to <hi>Job,</hi> who was alſo his Freind and Father.</p>
                  <q>He hath taken me by my neck.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>neck</hi> is as the tower and ſtrength of the body, and when a man is taken by the neck, he is aſſaulted in his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrength, and taken at the greateſt advantage.</p>
                  <p>There is a threefold metaphor, or alluſion in theſe words, which being conſidered diſtinctly, will let out their meaning yet more fully.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They beare an alluſion to Wreſtlers, who take one another by the neck, or collar; he that is the ſtrongeſt, not onely takes his Antagoniſt by the neck, but ſhakes him, as if he would ſhake him to pieces. God wreſtled with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Jacob</hi> literally and corporally (though the greateſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſtreſſe of <hi>Jacobs</hi> wreſtling was ſpirituall and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall) <hi>And when he ſaw that he prevailed not (Jacob</hi> prevailed with God for ſo much ſtrength, that now God could not (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48478:149"/> to that diſpenſation) prevaile againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet) <hi>he touched the hollow of Jacobs thigh, and made him halt.</hi> God wreſtled with <hi>Job,</hi> not corporally, yet in corporall things, the ſtreſſe alſo of his wreſtling was ſpirituall, and he prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with God, and over Satan; yet God was pleaſed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the preſent, to touch a joynt, and make him halt, but even to ſhake every joynt and limbe to peices.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is an alluſion to Sergeants or Bailiffs, that are ſent to areſt men for debt, or for their evill deeds: This ſort of men are boyſterous enough, they having power will not forbeare to lay hold on Perſons obnoxious, and take them by the neck, when they attach them. We have that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage expreſſed (<hi>Matth.</hi> 18.28.) The evill Servant, to whom the Lord had forgiven ten thouſand Talents (a vaſt debt) found one of his fellow Servants, who owed him an hundred pence (an inconſiderable ſumm) and would needs exact the utmoſt from him: the Text ſaith, <hi>The ſame Servant went out, and found one of his fellow-ſervants, which ought him an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pence, and he layd hands upon him, and took him by the throat, ſaying, Pay me that thou oweſt:</hi> He took him by the throat, the word ſignifies properly to choake,<note place="margin">

                     </note> or to take another ſo rudely by the throat, as to choake, or (as wee ſay) throttle him. It is tranſlated to choake with water (<hi>Mark</hi> 5.13.) and is applyable to any violent act by which the breath is ſtopt, eſpecially to taking by the neck, or throat.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is an alluſion, as ſome conceive, to Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in Warr, who when they have worſted an Adverſary, take him by the neck, and make him their priſoner: As it is the laſt act of tryumph and inſultation over an Enemy, to tread upon his neck (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.24.) <hi>Joſhua</hi> called all the men of Iſrael, and ſayd unto the Captaines of the men of Warr, which went with them, <hi>Come neere and put your feet upon the necks of theſe Kings: and they came neer and put their feet upon the necks of them;</hi> Now as it is (I ſay) the laſt act of tryumph <hi>to tread upon the necke:</hi> ſo it is the firſt act of tryumph <hi>to take by the neck. Job</hi> thought himſelfe uſed thus, <hi>Hee hath taken me by the necke,</hi> as a Wraſtler, as a Sergeant, or as a Victor in Warr.</p>

                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:48478:150"/>And hath ſhaken me to peices.</q>
                  <p>I will not let it paſſe unobſerved, that the word which we tranſlate <hi>to ſhake to peices,</hi> is but one in the Hebrew, but as that which we render <hi>to break aſunder,</hi> ſo this is doubled to highten the ſenſe, and intimate no ordinary, but a terrible ſhaking; ſuch a ſhaking as is followed with ſcattering, or a ſhaking,<note place="margin">

                  <p>A mark is not ſet up (or it is very rarely ſet up) for one ſhot: As God hath more mercies then one in ſtore for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo he hath more Arrows then one for them in his Quiver. When thou haſt received one ſhot, prepare for a ſecond, and a third.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God ſeemes to take pleaſure in afflicting his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alſo contributes to the proofe of the generall Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before given: For the more pleaſure any one takes in afflicting, the more ſeverity he ſhewes in afflicting. A Father chaſtiſeth his Childe with teares in his eyes; every ſtroake vvhich a vviſe Father gives his Childe, is as a wound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and this abates the ſmart of the blow; but for Fathers to doe it as the Apoſtle ſpeakes (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.) <hi>For their pleaſure,</hi> or vvhen it pleaſeth a Father (in that ſenſe) to doe it, this encreaſeth the ſmart. The ſufferer feeles moſt paine vvhen it is a pleaſure to another to make him ſuffer. Now, vvhat is ſhooting at a mark? No man ſhoots at a marke for toyle, to make a labour, and a buſineſſe of it, but men ſhoot at a mark for their recreation, and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>God delights not properly in the ſorrows and ſufferings of his people; he is not like thoſe cruell Tyrants, vvho faſten their Captives to a Poſt, and then ſhoot them dead for ſport:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48478:151"/> God doth not willingly, much leſſe ſportingly, afflict the Children of Men (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33.) yet it pleaſeth him to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict them; yea, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.) <hi>He laughs at the tryall of the innocent;</hi> that is, He carryes himſelfe (as to their ſenſe) as if he did not regard vvhat they ſuffered, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he be infinitely tender of them in all their ſufferings; yet becauſe they doe not alwayes underſtand the language of this laughter, it makes them cry out as if God had forſaken them, and were either really turned an Enemy againſt them, or at leaſt, did not uſe them as his Freinds; from which neer relation, nothing appeares more remote, then to be ſet up and ſhot at as a mark.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Affliction doth not hit the Saints by chance, but by direction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a great difference betweene ſhooting at randome, and ſhooting at a mark. <hi>God doth now draw his Bow at a venture</hi> (as he who ſlew <hi>Ahab</hi> did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.34.) or ſhoot at the vvhole hoſt of mankinde, let the Arrow light where and on vvhom it vvill, but he ſingles out the particular perſon, whom he intends to hit. Every one of his Arrows goes upon a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall errand, and touches no breaſt but that againſt whom it vvas ſent: And as this ſpeakes the honour of God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines as much, upon whom, as vvhat to doe, and chuſeth out thoſe at vvhom he meanes to ſhoot, as vvell as the meanes by vvhich he ſhoots at them; ſo it ſhould eſtabliſh our hearts to receive his ſhot, and in this ſenſe to be like a ſenſeleſſe mark which ſtirrs not from the Arrow, nor vvithdrawes from the deadly Bullet. It is not onely the grace, but the glory of a Beleever, when he can ſtand as a But-mark, and take affliction quietly. The Apoſtle ſpeakes neer this language, and fully this truth (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>I would that no man ſhould be moved for theſe afflictions; for you your ſelves know that we are appointed thereunto;</hi> As if he had ſayd, I would have you ſtand as Poſts, notwithſtanding all theſe afflictions: Not that he would have them careleſſe, or ſecure; but couragious, and full of holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedneſſe: I would have no man flinch, or ſtirr a foot, no more then a mark that is ſhot at, Why? <hi>Knowing that wee are appointed thereto:</hi> As a mark is appointed to be ſhot at, and ſet up on purpoſe that the Arrow may be directed againſt it;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48478:152"/> ſo the Lord ſets up his Saints and Servants on purpoſe, that he may ſhoot the Arrows of affliction at them; therefore let us keep our ground and not be moved. We honour God, yea it is our honour alſo, when we are unmoveable in active o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience as the Apoſtle exhorts (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58.) <hi>Wherefore my Brethren be ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, alway abounding in the worke of the Lord, for as much as yee know that your labour is not in vaine in the Lord.</hi> But as it is our honour, and Gods honour too, when we are unmoveable in doing the will of God; ſo it is a greater honour, both to him and us, when we are ſo in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will, or in paſſive obedience; when wee ſtand to it, and move no more in way of cowardiſe and impatience then a Poſt when it is ſhot at. This is the glory of a Chriſtian, and it is his duty; this is the glory of God, and it is his due; though it be put here as an aggravation of the greatneſſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction, that he was ſet as a ſtanding mark, yet it is a hightning of our praiſe, contentedly to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>God will make wicked men his <hi>ſtanding mark</hi> to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, againſt whom he will ſhoot the Arrowes, the poyſoned Arrows of his indignation, which ſhall drinke up their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and yet their ſpirits ſhall not be conſumed. God makes his precious Servants and faithfull people, his ſtanding mark for a time, they feele the Arrowes of affliction, and are deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded; as <hi>Job</hi> further proſecutes his ſad condition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the Allegory in the next Verſe.</p>

                     </note>God hath a Bow, he hath his Arrowes, and his Archers, all ready at a call. The decree of God is his Quiver, his Arrows are his purpoſes, and the Inſtruments which execute them are his Archers; whether rationall or irrationall, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, or things, any thing which God uſeth to afflict man by, is his Archer: <hi>His Archers have compaſſed mee about:</hi> The word is <hi>(Rabbi) His Archers,</hi> from <hi>Rab, great;</hi> ſo ſome read it, <hi>His great Ones have compaſſed me about.</hi> The word <hi>Rab,</hi> doth not onely ſignifie greatneſſe in bulke, or continued quantity, but in number or diſcreet quantity.

                  </p>
                  <p>He can make any creature his Archer; and he hath many Quivers full of Arrows. Old <hi>Jacob</hi> ſayd of <hi>Joſeph (Gen.</hi> 49.23.) <hi>The Archers ſhot ſore at him, and grieved him. Joſeph</hi> was a mark of envy, becauſe God had put ſo many markes of honour upon him: His owne Brethren were the Archers. <hi>Job</hi> had many Archers ſhooting at him: I can name you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eminent Archers that ſhot at <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Heaven was an Archer, the heavens ſhot fire, which burnt up his flocks of ſheep.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Ayre was an Archer, that ſhot winde, and downe fell the Houſe upon his Children.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Chaldeans and Sabeans were Archers, and they ſhot ſpoyling and plundering, they tooke away all his Cattell, and ſlew his Servants with the edge of the Sword.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Devill was an Archer, he ſhot diſeaſes, and wounded his body all over with ſoares.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The earth was an Archer, and that ſhot Wormes, he was cloathed with Worms, and clods of Earth.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, His Wife was an Archer, or an Archereſſe, ſhe ſhot terrible Arrows, evill and bitter words.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, His Freinds were Archers, they ſhot reproofes, and uncomfortable comforts; they peirced him with their ſalyes, and the very meanes that they uſed to heal him, grieved him more.</p>
                  <p>All theſe ſhot at him, hee muſt needs have many hurts, who was compaſſed about with ſo many Archers; <hi>David</hi> felt the anguiſh of theſe Arrows (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 38, 1.) <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chaſten mee in thy hot diſpleaſure: For thine arrows ſtick faſt in me, and thy hand preſſeth me ſore: David</hi> was full of Arrows, what thoſe Arrows were, is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the Text. One of the Ancients ſaith, They were the threatnings of God, with which his conſcience was wounded for ſin, as for his body and outward eſtate, they were in a whole skin; 'tis true, judgements or wrath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48478:153"/> wound the ſpirit deeper then judgements or wrath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted wound the outward man; and as the whole word of God, ſo that part of it eſpecially which conſiſts of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, is as the Apoſtle ſpeakes (<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>Quick and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, and ſharper then any two-edged Sword, peircing, even to the dividing aſunder of the ſoule and ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. Yet I rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that <hi>Davids</hi> Arrows were bodily troubles or diſeaſes, already inflicted, the immediate cauſe of which was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, and the cauſe of that vvas his owne ſinne, both vvhich are expreſſed at the third Verſe, <hi>There is no ſoundneſſe in my fleſh, becauſe of thine anger, neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin:</hi> When ſin ſtirrs up the anger of God, the anger of God can quickly ſend his Arrowes abroad; nor is there any thing in this World ſo neere unto us, but hee can make an Arrow, or an Archer of it; <hi>His Archers compaſſe me round.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſee what kind of Archers his were, they were no bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, they were good <hi>marks men;</hi> like the left handed <hi>Benjamites (Judg.</hi> 20.16.) <hi>They could ſhoot at a haires breadth and not miſſe:</hi> For it follows:
<q>He cleaveth my reines aſunder.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are expert Archers who can cleave the reines: The reines are in the middle of the back, he that ſhoots at a Butt, and hits the middle of it ſhoots exactly; the whole Butt is not the mark, but the White vvhich is ſet (according to a Geometricall proportion) in the middle of it. He that hits the mark, hits the middle of the Butt; but he that <hi>cleaves the Pin</hi> (that's the Archers Dialect) which faſtens the mark to the Butt, <hi>That's the Archer,</hi> or <hi>That's He</hi> (as they alſo uſe to ſpeake at their ſport) he wins the prize:<note place="margin">Renes ſedes ſunt affectus &amp; libidinis vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiſſimi.

                  <p>Further, We may underſtand it by a metaphor, and ſo two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The reynes being the ſeat of deſire, as Naturaliſts ſpeake; ſome interpret <hi>he cleaveth my reines aſunder,</hi> thus, <hi>He ſmites me in that which is to me moſt pleaſant and deſireable:</hi> and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48478:153"/> then, the ſeat of affection is put for the thing which we affect. This holds out a profitable truth.</p>
                  <q>God can wound us in that upon which wee moſt entirely ſet our affections.</q>
                  <p>He knowes how to cleave our very reines aſunder, and he often doth it; that which vve inordinately love, is uſually the mark at vvhich he aymes his Arrow: The readyeſt vvay to loſe any comfort, is to over-love it (I add that by vvay of caution, not of direction.) And indeed, though it be a great deal of ſmart to us, yet it may prove a great deal of eaſe to us, to be vvounded in that which vve over-love. God in much mercy to thoſe he loves, takes that from them vvhich they love too much, that ſo they may love him the more, to whom all their love, and more if they had it, is but due: <hi>He cleaves their reines, that their reines may cleave to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The reines in a metaphor,<note place="margin">Renes occultiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima denotant cor intelligit renes conſulunt.</note> ſignifie that which is moſt ſecret, and hidden (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.7.) <hi>My reines alſo inſtruct me in the night ſeaſon;</hi> that is, my moſt inward thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me, I have ſecret communion with my ſelfe, and my heart reads me <hi>a curtaine Lecture every night; My reines inſtruct mee in the night ſeaſon.</hi> This metaphoricall interpretation, gives us this plaine Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God peirceth into our moſt retired thoughts, and can puniſh our moſt ſecret ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe ſins which lye as much out of ſight, as the reines doe, he ſeeth, and he ſeeth them as plainely as an Archer doth the White, or marke, which ſtands open to the eye; for all things are naked and manifeſt (anatomiz'd, or cut open to the reines of the back, ſo much the word beares, and ſo manifeſt are we) before his eyes with whom we have to doe.</p>
                  <p>Take it literally, and then to <hi>cleave the reines</hi> is an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of putting a man to the greateſt ſorrow, or paine, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; if the back vvere chyned (as we ſpeake) and cut quite downe, through the reynes, this would be an exquiſite torment; the reynes are a very tender part: A deep vvound in ſome other parts of the body, is but a ſcratch, and ſuch vvounding were a kinde of embracing, in compariſon of that.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To cleave the reynes, is to weaken, becauſe the reynes, or the loynes, are the ſtrength of a man, or of any
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48478:154"/> creature; <hi>Loe his ſtrength is in his loynes,</hi> ſaith God of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemoth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Elumbem red<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dere.</note> which is as ſome thinke the Elephant (<hi>Job.</hi> 40.16.) And <hi>a man of no loynes, is a man of no ſtrength,</hi> in common language.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To cleave the reynes, is to give a mortall wound. Chyrurgions and Phyſitians obſerve, That if the reynes be ſtruck through,<note place="margin">Mala immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabilia indicat.</note> there is no helpe for it; cleaving the reynes is much like peircing the heart; this is preſent death, and that leaves no hope of life, the wound of it is incurable.</p>
                  <p>There is a fourth interpretation, <hi>He cleaveth my reynes,</hi> may note the torture of any acute diſeaſe, eſpecially that of <hi>the Stone in the reynes, or kidneys;</hi> which is as it were the cutting of the back aſunder; poore Patients under it are often heard ſo complaining: O 'tis like a ſharpe Knife; the Stone is not onely a grinding, but a cutting paine.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall onely lay in the conſideration of theſe foure gloſſes from the literall ſenſe of the word, to a further making out of the firſt generall Obſervation, <hi>That God often deales very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely in outward, or preſent diſpenſations, with many of his deareſt Servants:</hi> He doth that which they may call cleaving of the reines, and that, in the eaſieſt of the foure ſenſes, is a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere diſpenſation; much more (which wee may ſuppoſe) when the paine of all foure meets in one man; as doubtleſſe they did in <hi>Job; He cleaveth my reines aſunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And doth not ſpare.</q>

                  <p>Firſt, When wee doe leſſe then wee can. Wee having power, though no right to doe more then we doe, no nor to doe ſo much as we doe: Thus a Theefe may be ſayd to ſpare a man, when he doth not take all from him, life and all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When vve doe leſſe againſt another then we may, both according to the right of our cauſe, and the power in our hands: Thus a Magiſtrate ſpares a Theefe; or a Creditor his Debtor; when the one exacts not the vvhole puniſhment, nor the other the whole Summ due. And in this ſenſe God
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48478:154"/> ſpareth the Sons of men; he hath both power and right to puniſh ſinfull man to the utmoſt, but he ſpares him: To hold the hand, though but a little, is ſparing merccy; but <hi>Job</hi> found not this mercy, <hi>He doth not ſpare;</hi> as if he had ſayd, <hi>The Lord layes on, layes on, and doth not forbeare.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>There is mercy in ſparing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a fivefold mercy of God:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Rewarding mercy,</hi> towards thoſe who have done well.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Pardoning mercy,</hi> which is exerciſed towards thoſe who have done ill, or towards paſt ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Preventing mercy,</hi> when hee keeps us from evill, whether it be the evill of ſin, or of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Delivering mercy,</hi> when though he let us fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the evill of ſin or puniſhment, yet he is pleaſed to help us up, and takes us out againe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, There is <hi>Sparing mercy;</hi> if while we are in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God deales gently with us, this is ſparing mercy: As God was not pleaſed to prevent <hi>Jobs</hi> ſorrows, nor to deliver him from them, ſo he did not ſpare him in them, his hand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued heavy upon him, he had no eaſe.</p>
                  <p>There is a fourefould degree of this ſparing mercy of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Not to puniſh at all: thus God ſometimes ſpares his owne people, <hi>as a Father ſpares his Son that ſerveth him (Mal.</hi> 3.17.) Though they faile, yet he paſſeth it by, and doth not reckon with them for it. The Lord repreſented himſelfe to <hi>Amos,</hi> forming Graſſe-hoppers, which eyther in kinde, or in a figure (ſhaddowing the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi>) threatned to devoure the Land; this Viſion put the Prophet upon that earneſt prayer, <hi>O Lord God forgive, by whom ſhall Jacob ariſe for he is ſmall? The Lord repented for this, it ſhall not be ſaith the Lord (Amos</hi> 7.1, 2, 3.) Here was ſparing mercy, and this is repeated a ſecond time (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 6.) yet in the third Viſion of <hi>a Plumbe line</hi> (by which God was noted, taking exact notice of all the uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and crookedneſſe of that people in that Viſion, I ſay) as the Prophet ſuſpended prayer, ſo the Lord being reſolved, no longer to ſuſpend their puniſhment, ſaith, <hi>I will not paſſe by them againe any more:</hi> that is, I will ſpare them no more which is againe repeated (<hi>Chap.</hi> 8.2.) where by a Basket of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48478:155"/> fruit, the Lord ſhewed their ripeneſſe in ſin, and his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to puniſh, and not to ſpare.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is ſparing mercy, when puniſhment is defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or adjourned to a further day; thus the Lord ſpared the old World, a hundred and twenty yeares, <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alway ſtrive:</hi> It did a long time, he ſpared them many yeares to draw them to repentance, and to leave them inexcuſable, becauſe they repented not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is ſparing mercy, when judgement is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: When though God puniſh, yet he doth not puniſh to the full; when though the cloud break, yet he lets but a few drops fall on us, and doth not powre out ſhowres, or make an inundation to overwhelme us; when though he ſtrike, yet he gives but few ſtrokes; yea, if he abate but one ſtroke, it is ſparing mercy. The Jewes (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24.) gave <hi>Paul, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtripes, ſave one;</hi> and in this they would be thought to be mercifull, becauſe they might have given him forty by the Law (<hi>Deut.</hi> 25.3.) therefore to abate one, was ſparing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. As to puniſh beyond the Law, though it be but a little beyond, is cruelty; ſo to puniſh leſſe, though it be but a little leſſe, is mercy: And this is brought in as an argument of great mercy (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.38.) <hi>But he being full of compaſſion, forgave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not: yea many a time turned he his anger away, and did not ſtirr up all his wrath:</hi> They felt his wrath, but God did not ſtirr up all his wrath; they were ſmitten, but not deſtroyed, Juſtice did not make an utter end of them, there was mercy in that. The like read (<hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.28.) <hi>I will not let thee goe altogether unpuniſhed</hi> (yet I will ſpare thee, though I puniſh thee) <hi>I will correct thee in meaſure, I will not make a full end of thee.</hi> But are not all the corrections of God, yea and his judgements too done in meaſure? All the judgements of God are done in meaſure, as meaſure notes a rule of equity, but not as meaſure notes a rule of equality. Againe, to doe a thing by meaſure doth not alwayes note the rule by which it is done, but the degree in which it is done. And ſo to doe a thing in meaſure is to doe it moderately; as when it is ſayd (<hi>John</hi> 3.24.) That <hi>God gives not the ſpirit by meaſure to Chriſt:</hi> the meaning is onely this, hee gives him the ſpirit abundantly, infinitely, without ſtint or limit: So when it is ſayd, that he corrects man in meaſure, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48478:155"/> is onely this, that he corrects him moderately, merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with many ſtints and limits. <hi>It is of the Lords mercy,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremie Lam.</hi> 3.22.) What? That we are delivered? That we are crowned with comforts? Theſe are of the Lords mercy indeed, but hee ſpeakes not of theſe, the mercy hee ſpeakes of is, <hi>That we are not utterly conſumed.</hi> What kinde of mercy is this? Sparing mercy. Suppoſe God take away many Children, yet if he leave but one, here is ſparing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Parents: Suppoſe hee take many hundreds, and thouſands of a mans eſtate, yet if he leave him a little to buy Bread, and to ſtand betweene him and Beggery, this is ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mercy: Suppoſe we are much conſumed, yet if we are not utterly conſumed, this alſo is ſparing mercy. In the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> we read of a goodly tree, <hi>And behold a watcher and an holy one came downe from Heaven, and cryed aloud Hew downe the Tree and cut off his branches, ſhake off his leaves and ſcatter his fruit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nevertheleſſe leave the ſtumpe of his root in the earth,</hi> &amp;c. Though it was judgement to ſhake off the leaves and fruit, to hew downe the boughes and ſtock, yet it was ſparing mercy to leave the roote, that gave hopes it might grow againe, and not be utterly conſumed; 'tis ſparing mercy when any thing is reſerved: But God did not ſpare <hi>Job,</hi> he took all; he did not leave him (as we ſay) <hi>A Shirt to his back,</hi> nor a ſound patch in his skin: Satans power had no limit put to it, but as to life onely (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.6.) <hi>Behold he is in thine hand, but</hi> (or onely) <hi>ſave his life:</hi> There was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſomewhat of ſparing mercy in that, and that was more then Satan would have ſpared, yet it was but ſo much as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could not have groaned out this complaint, as to the loſſe of all other comforts, <hi>He doth not ſpare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is a ſparing mercy of God in the very act of afflicting, when hee ſhewes that he is unwilling to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, or diſcovers tenderneſſe to them that are afflicted (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.12.) <hi>He doth not willingly afflict nor greive the children of men.</hi> As there are many who will ſerve God in an outward forme of worſhip, whom yet they neither ſerve nor worſhip with their will: So God will afflict ſome, whom he doth not afflict with his will; he doth not give out his ſpirit, or take delight in ſmiting, while he ſmites them. Thus the Lord expreſſed himſelfe towards his ancient people the Jewes; he threatens
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48478:156"/> Iſrael, <hi>That the Aſſyrian ſhall be his King;</hi> that is, the Aſſyrian ſhall carry them Captives to <hi>Babylon</hi> and exerciſe a tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power over them (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.5.) <hi>Yea, the Sword ſhall abide on his Cities, and ſhall conſume his branches (Verſ.</hi> 6.) Now though God were reſolved to doe this, and did alſo bring it to paſſe; yet he ſaith (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 8.) <hi>How ſhall I give thee up Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im? How ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? (ſc:</hi> into the Enemies hand) <hi>How ſhall I make thee as Admah? How ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together: I will not execute the fierceneſſe of mine anger, I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim:</hi> that is, I will not deſtroy him wholly, by redoubling evill upon him: I will deſtroy once, but I will not returne to deſtroy, a remnant ſhall be ſaved. The Lord gave up <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but he did not make <hi>Ephraim</hi> as <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> he did not utterly ruine him; and what hee did againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he did it with a ſecret conteſt in his owne ſpirit, <hi>How ſhall I doe this?</hi> I doe it not with my heart, and whole minde, my heart is turned within me, while my hand is turned againſt thee; it grieveth me while thou art grieved, while I kindle this fire of affliction in thy borders, the fire of compaſſion kindles in my owne bowels; <hi>My repentings are kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together,</hi> while I puniſh thee for thine impenitency, and my heart is turned within me, while I muſt correct thee, <hi>for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to returne (Verſ.</hi> 5.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nero</hi> being deſired to ſigne a Writ for the execution of an Offender, was ſo pittifull at his firſt entrance upon the Empire (though he proved a Monſter for cruelty after) that he could hardly be perſwaded, or wrought to ſubſcribe it, and when he did it,<note place="margin">Quam vellem neſcire literas.</note> in doing it he ſayd, <hi>How glad ſhould I be if I could not write my name;</hi> which wiſh occaſioned <hi>Seneca</hi> his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to write a Book of <hi>Clemencie,</hi> in which he extols <hi>Nero,</hi> as the patterne and mirrour of clemencie: When either God or man doe acts of ſevereſt Juſtice, with meltings of ſpirit, and tenderneſſe of affection towards thoſe who fall under their hand, thoſe acts of Juſtice have a great temperament of ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mercy in them.</p>
                  <p>For as it is in ſinning, when a Beleever falls into a great ſin, yet becauſe his heart cannot goe fully with it, he cannot delight or take pleaſure in it, therefore his may be called <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſinfulneſſe:</hi> whereas a carnall heart committing onely a
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48478:156"/> little ſin, for the matter yet, becauſe he delighteth in it, and is pleaſed with ſin, he doth not ſpare to ſin. Now (I ſay) as it is in ſinning, ſo in puniſhing; he doth not ſpare to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, who doth it with his whole heart, and takes delight in it, though the actuall puniſhment be but little, whereas he whoſe heart retreats while his hand is ſtretched out in greater pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments, may be ſayd to ſpare in puniſhing.</p>
                  <p>Hence, to ſhew that God exacted the utmoſt of his Juſtice upon his Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when hee ſtood in our place; the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.) <hi>He ſpared not his Son.</hi> How did he not ſpare him? He did not ſpare him any of theſe foure wayes. He did not ſpare him, ſo, as not to puniſh him at all; for the Cup could not paſſe from him. He did not ſpare him by deferring the time, but when the houre was come that he muſt ſuffer, he ſuffered in that moment. Nor did he ſpare him in the degree, he ſuffered to the utmoſt for our ſins, God did not abate one drop out of his Cup, not one dram of the weight of his ſorrows: Yea fourthly, God did not ſpare him, in regard of the affection with which he puniſhed him: The Lord may be ſayd <hi>willingly to afflict him for the ſins of the Children of men, though he doth not willingly afflict the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men; He was pleaſed to bruiſe him (Iſa.</hi> 53.) and that ſignifies not onely <hi>(Voluntatem Dei)</hi> that it was the purpoſe and reſolution of God, that his Son ſhould be bruiſed for our ſins; but it ſignifies alſo <hi>(Voluptatem Dei)</hi> the delight, and contentment that the Lord had in bruiſing his Son. He did not ſpare, but gave him up with his heart, to thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were due to ſinners. God ſhewed no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting towards his Son, when he ſtood ſuffering in the place of ſinners, then he doth to thoſe ſinners who ſtand in their owne place to ſuffer without his Son: Yea, God the Father did not onely not relent, or ſhew any yearning of bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Son in that ſuffering condition, but (as to ſenſe and preſent apprehenſion) he hardned his heart towards him, which cauſed that greivous out-cry of Chriſt upon the Croſſe, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not that God did really withdraw his love in the leaſt, from his Son, but he did infinitely delight to ſee his Juſtice ſatiſfied; and his Son as a Conquerour, bearing up under the weight of it. Thus the Lord tooke pleaſure in afflicting his
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48478:157"/> Son, or (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.) <hi>He laughed at the tryall of that innocent and Holy one:</hi> And indeed, without this, the worke of our redemption had not been accompliſhed by a full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to divine Juſtice, for it would have had ſomewhat of mercy in it towards the Redeemer, as well as it is all mercy towards the redeemed: But as it is all of mercy to us, ſo it was to be nothing at all of mercy to Jeſus Chriſt, that ſinners are redeemed: he was to have no more of his Father then he payd for, and his Father did not ſpare him, but made him pay the utmoſt Farthing, that upon the caſting up of the account betweene himſelfe and ſinfull man appeared a due debt unto his Juſtice. <hi>Job</hi> complaines, that he was not ſpared, yet the truth is, that, every man how much ſoever he ſuffers on this ſide Hell, hath ſomewhat of ſparing mercy in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Foraſmuch as <hi>Job</hi> being about to ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of his affliction, tells us, <hi>That God did not ſpare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sparing mercy is the loweſt degree of mercy: If God deny ſparing mercy, he denyes all mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is argument enough that God ſhewed Chriſt no mercy, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He did not ſpare him.</hi> That we ſinners might have all mercy, he that ſaved us from our ſins had none. The Angels who ſinned found no mercy, no ſacrifice was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, <hi>God caſt them downe to Hell, and delivered them into chaines of darkneſſe, to be reſerved unto judgement:</hi> All which puniſhments are affirmed by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> as the reſult of this Negative, <hi>God ſpared not the Angels</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4.) The ſame Apoſtle tels us alſo in the next Verſe, that, <hi>God ſpared not the old World, but ſaved Noah, the eight perſon, a Preacher of righteouſneſſe, bringing in the Flood upon the world of the ungodly.</hi> Neyther the Angels who apoſtatiz'd from God, nor the old ungodly World had any ſhare in ſparing mercy. <hi>Job</hi> looked upon himſelfe (in reference to preſent peace) as one in their caſe, <hi>He doth not ſpare,</hi> which appeares further in the next clauſe.</p>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48478:157"/> 
                     <hi>Simon Magus (Acts</hi> 8.23.) puts theſe two together, <hi>I perceive that thou art in the Gall of bitterneſſe:</hi> He that continues in ſin, lives in the Gall of ſpirituall bitterneſſe, and he whoſe Gall is powred out, is in, or ready to goe into the gall or corporall death. For as <hi>cleaving of the reines,</hi> implyed the receiving of a deadly wound; ſo powring out the Gall upon the ground, is a proverbiall, ſpeaking preſent death. When the gall is out, the bowels are out; the gall is affixed to the Liver: So that, it is as much as to ſay, He kils me dead, or I am now upon the borders of death it ſelfe: When the gall is indeed powred out, we cannot live; and he who is afflicted to ſuch a height, that he cryes, my gall is powred out, may well he numbred among the dead. The reaſon or originall of this ſpeech was this (as I conceive) becauſe when a wilde Beaſt, or any other (which are fit for mans eating) are taken and ſlaine, it is uſuall when the bowels are pulled out, to cut off, and throw away, or powre out the Gall upon the ground, leſt the overflowing of it ſhould diſreliſh the neighbouring parts: So that <hi>Job</hi> in this doth onely proſecute the former theame of his greevious ſufferings, or that he was (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.) preſſed out of meaſure, above ſtrength, inſomuch that he deſpaired even of life; which he gives us yet more fully in the next Verſe.</p>

                     <hi>Thou haſt made a hedge about him: Jobs</hi> hedge was the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God; that hedge was ſo ſtrong that Satan could not pull up a ſtake of it, nor make a gap in it, till God gave him leave. But though <hi>Job</hi> (as this ſimilitude implyes) were like a wall or fortified tower, yet God had made breaches in him; God can ſoone breake our eſtates, our ſtrength, our health, our comforts, our peace, our all.

Now which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we take the proper ſenſe of that place; yet the common ſenſe of the words reaches this in <hi>Job:</hi> for <hi>precept upon precept,</hi> ſpeakes there a multitude of precepts, even as here, breach

                     </note>Thirdly, Running as a Giant, notes courage as well as ſtrength. A Giant runs fiercely and feareleſly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> compares the Sun at his riſing, to a Bridegroome comming out of his Chamber, and <hi>to a Giant, or ſtrong man</hi> (it is the word of this Text) <hi>who rejoyceth to run a race (Pſal.</hi> 19.5.) Giants are ſwift, and Giants are ſtrong; Some men are ſtrong but not ſwift of foot, but no man can be ſwift of foot unleſſe he be competently ſtrong, Giants are both in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: And therefore <hi>Job</hi> puts both together, <hi>He runs upon me as a Giant.</hi> And yet (I conceive) this running doth rather imply the fierceneſſe of the Giant, then his ſwiftneſſe. Giants
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48478:159"/> are dreadfull and terrible to behold; they are called <hi>Nephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi> in the Hebrew, of diverſe Texts, which comming from the root, <hi>Naphal, to fall,</hi> ſignifies <hi>fallers,</hi> and that in a twofold ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe they Apoſtatiz'd or fell from God, his truth and worſhip, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeemes to intimate, while he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the firſt great perſonall defection of the World (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.4.) <hi>There were Giants in the earth in thoſe dayes:</hi> theſe he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> in the ſame Verſe, who had alſo greatly corrupted themſelves, ſo that (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 5.) <hi>God ſaw the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man was great upon the earth:</hi> For the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> they who owned a profeſſion of Religion (being the Poſterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> they) mingled themſelves with the wicked of the World; as for the Giants, they diſowned God, and were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally departed, or fallen from his obedience, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſome apprehend, called <hi>Nephilim,</hi> or <hi>Fallers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, They were ſo called, becauſe either through the vaſtneſſe of their ſtrength and ſtature, or through the feirce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their mindes and ſpirits, they were men of violence, great oppreſſors, cauſing others to fall before them: In ſo much that the very name of a Giant was dreadfull. And when thoſe unbeleeving Scarchers of <hi>Canaan</hi> brought up an evill report of that Land, the worſt which they could ſay of it to the diſcouragement of their Brethren, was this (<hi>Numb.</hi> 13.33.) <hi>And there we ſaw the Giants, the Sons of Anak, which came of the Giants: and we were in our owne ſight as Graſſe-hoppers, and ſo we were in theirs.</hi> Men of ſtrength and courage were as much afrayd at this ſtory of Giants, as Children are of Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares and Fayries.</p>
                  <p>So then, when <hi>Job</hi> ſayd, That God did run upon him as a Giant, his intent was onely to ſhew, with how much terrour God was pleaſed to cloath himſelfe, and how much ſtrength he put forth, while he thus contended with him. The truth is, God needs not lay out his ſtrength to afflict man, he can cruſh the ſtrongeſt of men as a moth, with the touch of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then man; yet God in afflicting his people, will ſometimes perſonate a mighty man, exerciſing his power to the utmoſt, and arming himſelfe from head to foot, while he combates with an enemy: which ſtill confirmes the generall Obſervation, <hi>That God doth not onely
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48478:160"/> afflict ſuch as he loves, but he afflicts them ſorely. Doth he not ſo, when he ſhaks them in peices? Doth he not ſo, when he ſets them as his mark? When a multitude of skilfull Archers compaſſe them about; when he cleaves their reines aſunder; when he powres out their Gall upon the ground? Doth he not ſo, when he ſets Engines of battery to make breach upon breach, and then runs up as a Giant to the aſſault?</hi> Thus God hath dealt with many precious ſoules, and thus he dealt (beyond his dealings with many) with his precious Servant <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as no man, eyther in his eſtate or health, either in his credit or comforts, is <hi>ſo ſtrong a wall,</hi> but God by his <hi>Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery</hi> can quickly make a breach upon him; ſo who is able to ſtand in the breach, or make it good, when God comes up to the aſſault? <hi>Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be ſtrong in the dayes that I ſhall deale with thee?</hi> ſaith the Lord (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14.) When the <hi>Lord as a Giant</hi> runs upon man, the <hi>ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Giant</hi> among the ſons of men, is but as a <hi>Pigmie,</hi> yea but as a <hi>Piſmire,</hi> he is but as the <hi>Chaffe</hi> before the winde, or as the <hi>potters Veſſell</hi> before the Iron Rod. But though <hi>fleſh and blood</hi> cannot ſtand in the breach when God aſſaults; yet <hi>Faith and patience</hi> can. <hi>Moſes by Faith ſtood in the breach, and turned away the wrath of God, when he came to deſtroy Iſrael (Pſal.</hi> 106.23.) <hi>Job</hi> by patience ſtood in the breaches which God made upon him, when he ſeemed utterly to deſtroy him.</p>
                  <p>For what did <hi>Job</hi> to God, when God did all this to him? Did he oppoſe? Did he ſtrive with his Maker? The two next Verſes ſhew, that prayers and teares were all the Weapons he uſed in this holy Warr with God.</p>

And as there he told us what God had done to him, ſo here he tells what he did, or how he behaved himſelfe under the hand of God; he tells us how he took thoſe tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and thoſe wounds; how he received thoſe ſhowres of Arrows from the Almighties Bow. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> taxed <hi>Job</hi> in the fifteenth Chapter, with height and haughtineſſe of ſpirit in his low eſtate (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 12.13.) <hi>Why doth thine heart carry thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?

                  <p>A practicall anſwer is the ſtrongeſt anſwer; we may ſpeak more for our ſelves by our hands, then we can doe by our tongues in many caſes. The Papiſts mouths are ſtopt (who call us <hi>Solifidians</hi>) when they ſee Proteſtants forward in, and zealous for good workes: He that is accuſed of uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, may beſt free himſelfe from that charge, by giving freely to the poore; and he that is accuſed of injuſtice, may ſooneſt doe himſelfe right, by ſhewing that he hath done right to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man.

                  <p>And this <hi>Job</hi> offers, as to remove, and take away that obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of miſ-behaviour towards God;<note place="margin">Hoc aſſert ut ad miſerecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam ſocios mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat, paeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, <hi>ſc:</hi> ſuam &amp; humilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, quod ſeſe in his afflictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus non extu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerit. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> ſo to move his Freinds to better behaviour, even to compaſſion, and pitty towards him. He was in a ſorrowfull caſe, and he had acted the part of a ſorrowfull man; God had layd him low, and hee layd himſelfe low; this might have taught them moderation; why ſhould they ſpeake ſo harſhly againſt him, who had dealt but courſely with himſelfe? <hi>Sowing ſack-cloth upon his skin;</hi> and ſeeing he abaſed himſelfe, even <hi>to the defiling of his horne in the duſt,</hi> why ſhould they abaſe him too? It ſtirrs up pitty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a profeſſed adverſary to ſee him in miſery, eſpecially, when he ſubmits unto it, and ſuffers with patience: Much more ſhould the miſery of a profeſſed Freind, he alſo quietly ſubmitting to it, ſtirr up the bowels of pitie. So then, the ſcope of this report which <hi>Job</hi> makes of himſelfe, was not onely to anſwer what <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had charged him with, but

                  <p>The Roman Hiſtorian reports of <hi>cruell Nero,</hi> that when he fled out of the City, (fearing the ſentence of the diſpleaſed Senate which quickly purſued him) and had got into a grove or thicket like a wilde Beaſt, he commanded thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him to make a trench in the earth, fitted to the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his body, which he ordered them to line with ſuch peeces of Marble, as were to be had upon the place; thus as it were, preparing his owne Tombe, he wept and often cryed out, <hi>See what a workman is here now ready to periſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> What that wretch ſayd of himſelfe, I may ſay of this holy man in the Text, whom I finde thus buſied at his Needle, as if he were preparing his owne Grave-clothes, or winding-ſheet, <hi>What a workman have we here ready to periſh? Job</hi> looked upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a dying man,<note place="margin">Qualis artifex pereo.</note> and behold he is <hi>ſowing ſack-cloth upon his skin.</hi> When men of worth dye, they are wrapt in fine linnen, ſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> wrapt the body of <hi>Jeſus (Mark</hi> 15.46.) And a living man full of ſoares needs the fineſt and ſofteſt linnen to wrap him in: Sack-cloth is a courſe ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne cloth, greevous to a ſound body, painefull to thoſe who have never a breach upon their fleſh; but for a man (as <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes himſelfe) full of breaches, having breach upon breach, his body being broken all over, as if it were but one continued breach, to lap up ſuch a one in ſack-cloth, is an extreame addition to his paines and ſorrows. How is it then, that <hi>Job</hi> was thus ſevere to his owne ſoares? To cleare this, <hi>Sack-cloth</hi> may be taken two wayes.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Properly, ſo, ſack-cloth is that hairy, rough Garment which was very uſuall among mourners, whether in times of ſorrow for ſin or judgement. <hi>Sack-cloth was the Livery of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48478:162"/> both theſe ſorrows.</hi> The King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a cloſe-mourner in ſack-cloth (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.30.) <hi>The King rent his clothes as he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and behold he had ſack-cloth within upon his fleſh.</hi> There being a terrible Famine in <hi>Samaria,</hi> that Kings wore Sackcloth as an embleme of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, yet he wore it ſomewhat concealedly, it was <hi>within up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fleſh.</hi> And ſo (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.31.) when the Servants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> came to <hi>Achab,</hi> they put ſack-cloth upon them. And (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27.) <hi>Achab</hi> himſelfe when hee heard that ſore judgement denounced againſt him, <hi>humbled himſelfe, and put on ſack-cloth, and went ſoftly.</hi> In a time of common calamity, the Prophet tells us, <hi>Every head ſhall be bald, and every beard clipt: upon all the hands ſhall be cuttings, and upon the loynes ſack-cloth (Jer.</hi> 48.37.) And that it was the uſuall weare in time of repentance, is taught us in the Propheſie of <hi>Jonah</hi> (3.8.) where Proclamation was made, by the King of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> That all ſhould faſt and put on ſack-cloth. Chriſt himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing what <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> would have done if the Goſpell had been Preached, or the mighty workes done in them which were done in <hi>Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Corazin,</hi> ſaith, <hi>They would have repented long agoe in ſack-cloth and aſhes:</hi> that is, they would have put on ſack-cloth, and ſate in aſhes, in token of deepeſt humiliation for ſin. Thus ſack-cloth properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken was often uſed in times of great affliction, whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall, or publique; as alſo in times of deepeſt and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed repentance.</p>

                     </note>Firſt, As to <hi>Jobs</hi> then preſent condition, hee was full of ſores, and thoſe ſores were to him as a courſe covering of ſack-cloth: for he was ſore all over: In ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſeaſes, a ſcab puts forth all over the body, like the bark of a tree. <hi>Jobs</hi> ſcabs and ſores were like the barke of a tree, or a garment of ſack-cloth; hee ſpeakes neere this language (<hi>Chap.</hi> 30.18.) <hi>By the great force of my diſeaſe is my Garment changed:</hi> As if he had ſayd, I have another kinde of Garment then I was wont to weare; I was wont to weare the beſt, and the coſtlyeſt Garments; but now, <hi>By the force of my diſeaſe is my Garment changed, it bindeth me about as the colour of my coat:</hi> that is, My ſores binde me about as the colour of my Coat.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48478:162"/> Thus the Greek Expoſitors render this Text, affirming,<note place="margin">Nigrorem na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta eſt cutis mea propter cruciatuum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbitatem qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi ſaccus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ex vellis contextis effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                     </note> that his Skin was diſcouloured and black, and began to look like ſack-cloth, through the heat and diſtemper of his inward parts: As health and ſoundneſſe of conſtitution put out a freſh and lively tincture, ſo ſickneſſe and diſeaſes deface and darken the beauty of the body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take it again improperly, as to <hi>Jobs</hi> then preſent action; and then, <hi>I ſowed ſack-cloth upon my skin,</hi> is, as if hee had ſpoken plainely, I have greatly abaſed, or humbled my ſelfe, I have beene as one who putteth on ſack-cloth. Such was his poſture (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>He tooke a pot-ſheard, and ſcraped his ſores, and ſate downe among the aſhes.</hi> As he who wore ſack-cloth did humble himſelfe greatly, or at leaſt would be accounted to have done ſo; ſo he that is really humbled, and that greatly, may be ſayd to have put on ſack-cloth. The ſigne is often put for the thing ſignified, in reference both to joy and ſorrow. White garments and unctions were ſignes of joy; and therefore when <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorts to joyfulneſſe, hee ſaith, <hi>Let thy garments be alwayes white, and let thine head lack no oyntment (Eccleſ.</hi> 9.8.) which we may expound either by that which goes before, <hi>Eate thy bread with joy, and drinke thy Wine with a merry heart (Verſ.</hi> 7.) or by that which follows (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 9.) <hi>Live joyfully with the wife of thy youth:</hi> As to bid a man put on white garments is to bid him rejoyce, ſo to bid a man put on blacks, or ſack-cloth, is to bid him mourn; and he who ſaith as <hi>Job</hi> here, that he hath done it, ſaith, That he hath mourned, though he hath not done it. <hi>Job</hi> did not ſow ſack-cloth upon his skin when he ſpake thus, but his ſorrows did truely ſpeak ſack-cloth: Such alſo is his ſenſe of the next clauſe; where he profeſſeth,

                  <p>Firſt, That the earth was polluted, where ſuch refuſers of the precious Goſpell did inhabite, and was therefore to be ſhaken off as a filthy thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That they were baſe and vile as duſt, ſuch as God would ſhake off.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the duſt of the Apoſtles feet there left, might be as a witneſſe (ſo the other Goſpels expreſſe it) againſt them, that the Goſpell had been Preached there.</p>
                  <p>Duſt alſo in a proper ſenſe, was uſed in times of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſorrow among the Jewes; for then, they eyther ſprinkled duſt on their heads, or lay downe in the duſt: <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> and the Elders of Iſrael put duſt on their heads (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.6.) and <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth (<hi>Chap.</hi> 42.6.) <hi>Therefore I abhorr my ſelfe, and repent in duſt and aſhes:</hi> Which wee may underſtand either ſtrictly, that he ſate downe in the duſt, teſtifying his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or largely, that his was a great and a deep repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, even like theirs, who are humbled in duſt and aſhes. That carnall worldly ſorrow of the Merchants and Freinds of <hi>Babylon</hi> is thus expreſſed (<hi>Revel.</hi> 18.18, 19.) <hi>And they caſt duſt on their heads, and cryed, weeping and wayling, ſaying, Alas, alas, that great City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Improperly, duſt ſignifies any very low condition (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.7. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>He raiſeth the poore out of the duſt.</hi> And againe (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.2.) <hi>For as much as I exalted thee out of the duſt, and made thee a Prince over my people Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. To be exalted from the duſt, is to be exalted from among the common people to a princely ſtate, as that parallell place tels us (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.7.) All men are but levell with the duſt in their naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but all Magiſtrates are above the duſt (that is, the common people) by their civill conſtitution. When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have defiled my horne in the duſt;</hi> it may be underſtood either properly, that he did ſit downe in duſt and aſhes as he ſpeakes (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.) or improperly, that as God had brought him into a low condition, ſo he was willing to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48478:164"/> to a low condition, and to be, not onely as <hi>man</hi> who is duſt in his nature, and muſt returne to duſt, but as becomes <hi>that man</hi> whoſe power and honour, whoſe excellency and greatneſſe is layd in the duſt: <hi>David</hi> imprecates (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.5.) <hi>If I have done this, if</hi> (as ſome charge and ſuſpect me) <hi>there be iniquity in my hands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let the enemy perſecute my ſoule, and take it; yea, let him tread my life downe to the earth, and lay mine honour in the duſt:</hi> that is, Let him totally ruine me, or lay me as low, as low can be.

                  <p>The laſt ſort is applyable to both the former; it reſpects ſometimes worldly ſorrow, and ſometimes godly ſorrow; for both may be feyned: Such were thoſe teares (<hi>Jer.</hi> 41.) when <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had killed <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>Iſhmael went to Mizpeh, and met the men, weeping all along as he went;</hi> as if he had been greatly troubled for the afflictions of the Land; but they were <hi>Crokadiles teares.

                  <p>Thus we have <hi>Jobs</hi> behaviour in his affliction by a twofold act, and a twofold effect of it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt act was, <hi>Sowing ſack-cloth on his fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond was, <hi>Defiling his horne in the duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt effect was, <hi>Fouleneſſe upon his face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond was, <hi>Death upon his eyes.</hi>

                  <p>As <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions were great, ſo was his ſorrowe, and ſo was his ſubmiſſion: <hi>Sorrow is not contrary to patience; Job</hi> was the moſt pati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt, and the moſt ſorrowfull man in the World. There is an immoderate ſorrow inconſiſtent with patience, but great ſorrow is not onely conſiſtent with patience, but an argument of it; and unleſſe we have ſome ſorrow, we are not patient at all: how can he be called patient, who either feeles not, or ſlights his affliction. It is as ill a ſymptome of a diſeaſed ſoule to be unſenſible of judgements, as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of mercies. Unleſſe wee feele the rod, wee cannot heare the voice of the rod, nor receive inſtruction by it. To be as a Trunk, or a Stone, under correction, is not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient under it, but to deſpiſe it: <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God,</hi> is the advice of the ſpirit, by the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6.) As God humbles us for ſin, or for the tryall of grace, ſo they who have grace receive power to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and to humble our ſelves, is not onely an act, but an high act of grace; both the grace of God toward us, and the graces of God in us are exalted when wee are low in our owne eyes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the manner of this ſorrowful humiliation, <hi>He ſowed ſack-cloth upon his skin, and defiled his horne in the duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That as God letteth out viſible tokens of his afflicting hand upon us, ſo we ſhould let out viſible tokens of our humiliation under his hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As we are viſibly afflicted, ſo we ſhould be viſibly affected. We may make our humblings ſeene, though we muſt not doe it to be ſeene. As <hi>the light</hi> of our active obedience, <hi>ſhould ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee our good workes, and glorifie our
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48478:165"/> Father which is in Heaven (Matth.</hi> 5.16.) So alſo ſhould the light of our paſſive obedience ſhine before men, that they may ſee our holy ſufferings, and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven. It is as great a ſin to boaſt of our poverty, as it is to boaſt of our riches, and as great a vanity to be proud of a croſſe, as to be proud of a Crowne; yet it is an honour to God, when men ſee that we are not aſhamed either of poverty or of a croſſe. The croſſe ſhould be carryed upon our ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, not put up in our pockets: God loves to ſee us owne our troubles as well as our comforts; and as hee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe who wrap the Talent of their gifts and abilities in a Napkin, and hide it from the uſe of others; ſo he doth not approve thoſe who wrap up their croſſes and afflictions in a Napkin, and hide them from the ſight of others: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering, that even theſe alſo are Talents for which we ſtand accountable, how vve have uſed them, both for our owne good, and the good of others. <hi>I have ſurely heard E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim bemoaning himſelfe thus</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>Thou haſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed (Jer.</hi> 31.18.) <hi>Ephraims</hi> outward moanes were as muſick in the eares of God; <hi>Ephraim</hi> did not murmure againſt God, but he bemoaned himſelfe; <hi>Ephraim</hi> was not angry at his chaſtiſement, but <hi>Ephraim</hi> mourned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chaſtiſed; God heard this fully, in hearing hee heard it, or, it pleaſed him to heare it. It is our duty to teſtifie our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by the ſaddeſt notes of a troubled ſpirit, and it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to God when vve doe ſo; not that hee delights in our ſorrows; but he delights in the witneſſe vvhich vve beare to his wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, and faithfulneſſe, in ſending thoſe ſorrowes. <hi>I heard Ephraim bemoane himſelfe.</hi> Will an offendor that lookes for mercy come before the Judge in rich apparrell, or in ſome affected dreſſe? Comes he not rather in his Priſon clothes, puts he not on the garments of heavineſſe? The Meſſengers of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> put duſt on their heads, and ropes about their necks, and ſack-cloth on their loynes, when they came to mediate for the life of their Maſter. And thus the Lord ſpeakes to the Iſraelites (<hi>Exod.</hi> 33.5.) when they had ſinned, and he was wroth, <hi>Put off your Ornaments that I may know what to doe with you:</hi> Ornaments are uncomly when God is threatning judgements: It is time for us to lay by our bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, when God is about to make us naked. Sack-cloth ſowed
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48478:166"/> upon the skin, and our horne in the duſt, are the beſt enſignes of an afflicted ſtate. The Prophets counſell indeed is (<hi>Joel</hi> 2.13.) <hi>Rend your hearts and not your garments.</hi> (Rending the garments may be taken, not onely ſtrictly for that act, but largely for all outward actings of ſorrow) Yet when he ſaith, <hi>Rent not,</hi> this is not a prohibition of, but a caution about the outward acting of their ſorrow. <hi>Not,</hi> in Scripture, is not alwayes totally negative, it is often directive and compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: So in this place, <hi>Rend your hearts and not your garments,</hi> is, <hi>your hearts,</hi> rather then <hi>your garments;</hi> or be ſure to rend your hearts, as well as your garments: The one muſt be done, the other ought not to be left undone. See more of this (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20.) upon thoſe word, <hi>Then Job rent his Mantle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Great ſorrow produceth great effects, and leaveth ſuch impreſſions as teſtifie where it is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaith of the ſorrow of the World, <hi>That it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth death</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.) The ſorrow of the World may be taken two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the ſorrow of carnall worldly men, whoſe ſorrow for ſin is only a vexing of their hearts, not a breaking or hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of their hearts; which being ſeparate both from true faith for the pardon of ſin, and from any reall purpoſe of leaving their ſin, <hi>worketh death,</hi> both temporall death, often wearing out their naturall life lingringly, and ſometime deſtroying their naturall life violently, as in <hi>Judas,</hi> as alſo haſtning them on to eternall death, of which it ſelfe is a foretaſt, or beginning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ſorrow of the World, is a ſorrow for the loſſe of, or diſappoyntments about worldly things. This alſo worketh both thoſe deaths in meere worldly men; and when it is exceſſive (as under a temptation it may be) in a godly man, it may be ſayd to worke the death of the body in him; yea great and continued ſorrow, though it be not exceſſive, worketh towards this death in a godly man, drying his bones, and drawing out his ſpirits, as is cleare in <hi>Job,</hi> on whoſe eye-lids the very ſhadow of death ſate, while hee wept and ſorrowed. 'Tis hard to diſſemble a little griefe, but a great deale cannot be hid: As godly ſorrow manifeſts it ſelfe in excellent effects upon the ſoule, of which the Apoſtle num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48478:166"/> up ſeven at the eleventh Verſe of that Chapter, <hi>For this ſelfe ſame thing that yee ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it wrought in you; yea what clearing of your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Now I ſay, as godly ſorrow manifeſts it ſelfe in manifold effects upon the ſoule, ſo doth the ſorrow of the World ſet its marks upon the body: As a good mans heart is made cleane by wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the teares of godly ſorrow, ſo every mans face is made foule by weeping the teares of worldly ſorrow; and as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow worketh repentance unto ſalvation and life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſo the ſorrow of the World vvorketh an entrance to temporall death; yea, we may ſay that godly ſorrow doth ſometimes worke temporall death; <hi>Paul</hi> was afrayd leſt the inceſtuous perſon while he was repenting, might be <hi>Swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with over much ſorrow</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.) vvhich as vvee are to underſtand cheifely of a ſwallowing up in the gulfe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, ſo we may take in that alſo as a conſequent of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a ſwallowing of him up in the Grave of death; as if hee had ſayd, The poore man may both deſpayre and dye under this burden, if you let it lye too long upon him. As ſoone as <hi>Heman</hi> had ſayd (in his deſertion) <hi>My ſoule is full of troubles,</hi> he preſently adds, <hi>And my life draweth nigh unto the Grave, I am counted with them that goe downe to the pit, free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead (Pſal.</hi> 88.3, 4, 5.) To which he ſubjoyns (<hi>Ver.</hi> 9.) <hi>Mine eye mourneth by reaſon of affliction,</hi> and then expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>Wilt thou ſhew wonders to the dead? Shall the dead ariſe and praiſe thee?</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Theſe ſorrows will bring me to my grave,</hi> or in the language of <hi>Job, On my eye-lids is the ſhadow of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Till wee enjoy a life beyond the reach of all ſorrows, wee ſhall not be beyond the reach of death. Hence that promiſe (<hi>Revel.</hi> 21.4.) <hi>God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neyther ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more paine:</hi> And as that life which hath no death in it, ſhall have no ſorrow in it, ſo that life which is a continuall death (the life of the damned) is nothing elſe but ſorrow. <hi>There ſhall be weeping and wayling, and gnaſhing of teeth, for evermore (Mat.</hi> 13.42.) Their eyes ſhall ever weep, their faces ſhall ever be foule with weeping, and on their eye-lids the ſhadow of death ſhall dwell for ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The hand of God being heavy upon <hi>Job, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48478:167"/> his horne in the duſt, and fouled his face with weeping;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded neyther the beauty of his face, nor the dignity of his condition, all was nothing to him.</p>
                  <p>Learne from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Great afflictions take off our reſpect to the World, and all worldly things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is honour? What is Gold or Silver? What is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Houſe? What is a beautifull Wife, and pleaſant Children? What are fine cloathes, or a faire face in a day of ſorrow, or in the approaches of death? Spirituals are higheſt prized when we are loweſt: Grace ſhines cleareſt in worldly dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but the light of worldly enjoyments is darkneſſe to us, and that vvhich ſome eſteeme as a Sun, is but a Cloud to us in the day of diſtreſſe: That is beſt which is good to us in our worſt eſtate. The favour of God, the pardon of ſin, the fruites of the ſpirit, are alwayes pleaſant to the Saints, but then moſt when the yeares, or times are upon them, of which they not onely ſay with the Preacher (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1.) Wee have no pleaſure in them, but, vve have much paine and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in them. The face of the new creature is never foul with vveeping, nor is the horne of our ſalvation defiled when vvee lye in the duſt, or on the dunghill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having (according to his manner) accurately deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his calamities, and ſhewed vvith vvhat deep ſenſe, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abaſement he had entertained them; he paſſeth to a refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that inference vvhich his Freinds drew, and had often preſſed upon him from thoſe premiſes of his affliction. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> ſuggeſted him impious and unjuſt, becauſe hee was thus ſmitten. <hi>Job</hi> plainly denyes it (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 17.) I have not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe wounds in my body and eſtate, <hi>for any injuſtice in my hands,</hi> no, nor for any impiety in my heart, <hi>alſo my prayer is pure.</hi> This Verſe takes off both parts of that generall aſſertion, as to <hi>Jobs</hi> perſonall condition (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 34.) <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Hypocrites ſhall be deſolate, fire ſhall conſume the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of bribery.</hi> There <hi>Eliphaz</hi> cloſely hinted that <hi>Job</hi> was an Unjuſt man, and an Hypocrite: <hi>Job</hi> anſwers, no, my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle is not the Tabernacle of bribery, <hi>there is no injuſtice in my hands;</hi> my Congregation, or thoſe with whom I joyned in vvorſhip vvere not a Congregation of Hypocrites, <hi>my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is pure:</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Though it be a truth, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48478:167"/> of Hypocrites ſhall be deſolate, yet it doth not follow, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is an Hypocrite, whoſe Congregation is made deſolate, for mine is deſolate, and yet I know my prayer is pure: And though fire ſhall conſume the Tabernacles of bribery, yet every man is not guilty of bribery, whoſe Tabernacle is conſumed with fire, for ſo is mine, and yet I avouch it, there is no injuſtice in my hands.</hi>

The Harpie being a ravenous Foule, hath his name from this root in Hebrew (as alſo in the Greek from one of the ſame importance) becauſe he doth not ſubtlely ſurprize his prey, but openly aſſault it. It ſignifies alſo violence ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſcorne and contempt; as is obſerved upon that of the Prophet (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26.) <hi>Her Prieſts have violated my Laws:</hi> The Prieſts did not goe behinde the doore, they made an open breach upon the Law of God; they did not ſin ſecretly, as if they had been afrayd to be ſeen, but avowedly and before the Sun. Hence ſome have rendred that Text, <hi>Her Prieſts have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned my Lawes;</hi> noting eyther that it was a violation vvith contempt; or that Lawes which are once contemned cannot be long unviolated. Thus <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth, there is no ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in my hand; <hi>Job</hi> did not diſclaime all faylings in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice, but all intendments of doing injuſtice, he did not peremptorily deny that there was no injuſtice in his hand ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from miſtakes of the Law, but none from contempt of the Law, <hi>Not for any injuſtice,</hi>
                     <q>In my [hand.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Injuſtice is aſcribed to the <hi>hand,</hi> not becauſe injuſtice is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, though uſually it be done with the hand; vvith the hand men take away, and vvith that men detaine the right of others. <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes thus (2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 12.17.) <hi>Seenig there is no wrong in mine hand;</hi> that is, I have done no wrong. The hand is the great inſtrument of action, moſt injuſtice is done by the hand, though much be done by the tongue; and a Judge who gives an unjuſt ſentence with his tongue, may be ſayd to have injuſtice in his hands. Beſides, he may be ſayd to have injuſtice in his hands, who keeps any thing in his hands vvhich vvas
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48478:168"/> gotten by injuſtice; he alſo may be ſayd to eate injuſtice, who feeds upon vvhat he got unjuſtly (<hi>Prov.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>They eate the Bread of wickedneſſe, and drink the Wine of violence:</hi> that is, they eate Bread, and drink Wine, gotten by wickedneſſe and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>Job</hi> diſclaimes injuſtice in all theſe notions, <hi>There is no injuſtice in my hands;</hi> as if hee had ſayd, <hi>I have not gotten wealth by injuſtice, nor enricht my ſelfe by making others poore, I have not been as an Harpie, to ſcratch and teare from others to feed my ſelfe:</hi> Hee gives a full account of this (<hi>Chap.</hi> 29. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.) wiping off thoſe aſperſions of injuſtice, by a large narrative of his proceedings in that publick capacity, as a Magiſtrate; the breviate of vvhich is ſummed up in this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>There is no injuſtice in my hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, Injuſtice may be taken two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Either ſtrictly, for the act of a Magiſtrate perverting the Law and going beſides the rules of righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Or largely, for any wrong that one neighbour in a private capacity, doth another.</p>
                  <p>To doe juſtice is every ones duty as well as the Magiſtrates: vve uſe to ſay, <hi>Every man is eyther a Foole or a Phyſitian;</hi> vvee may ſay, <hi>Every one is eyther a doer of juſtice, or a diſhoneſt man:</hi> For though to doe juſtice is chiefely the Magiſtrates work, yet no man (who hath any thing to doe in the World) can live as he ought, vvithout doing juſtice: In this large ſenſe alſo vve may expound <hi>Jobs</hi> diſclaimer of injuſtice; as if he had ſayd, <hi>I have not willingly fayled in any of thoſe duties which the Law of love towards my neighbour calls for, and obliges me unto: There is no injuſtice in my hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Alſo my prayer is pure.</q>
                  <p>Prayer is taken two vvayes, as injuſtice is.</p>
                  <p>Eyther largely, for the whole vvorſhip of God, <hi>My houſe ſhall be called the houſe of prayer (Matth.</hi> 21.13.) that is, All kinde of publick worſhip ſhall be performed, and tendered to me there: Prayer being ſo principall a part of vvorſhip, may vvell comprehend all the parts of worſhip; that which is chiefe in any kinde, often denominates all the reſt. So <hi>Love</hi> is put for all the duties of the Law, and <hi>Faith</hi> for all the duties, yea, and for all the Doctrines of the Goſpell, though in both, many other duties and Doctrines are contained.</p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:48478:168"/>
                  <p>Strictly, Prayer is that part or worſhip which conſiſts in calling upon God: <hi>Prayer is the making knowne of our deſires, or the opening of our hearts to God. It is the aſcent of our ſoules to God. David being about to pray,</hi> ſaith, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee O Lord doe I lift up my ſoule.</hi> In this place we may take prayer in both the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, <hi>My prayer,</hi>
                     <q>Is pure.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word ſignifies ſhining, bright, glorious; a gracious prayer ſhines ſo bright that there is a glory in it; <hi>My prayer is pure. Zophar</hi> charged <hi>Job</hi> for ſaying, <hi>My doctrine is pure (Chap.</hi> 12.4.) Now <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe ſaith, <hi>My prayer is pure.</hi> The truth of Doctrine is the purity of it, and the ſincerity of prayer is the purity of it: <hi>Job</hi> did not boaſt his prayer pure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infirmity, but he did profeſſe it pure without hypocriſie. Yet beſides this caſting out of hypocriſie, there are diverſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients to be taken in towards the compoſition of a pure prayer, of which I ſhall touch more diſtinctly by and by. We read in the Inſtitutes of the Ceremoniall Law of pure Myrrhe, of pure Frankincenſe, of pure Oyle, of pure Incenſe, all which concurred to pure worſhip among the Jewes, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out all pure worſhip, both among Jewes and Gentiles; of the latter the Lord ſaith (<hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11.) <hi>From the riſing of the Sun unto the going downe of the ſame, my name ſhall be called upon among the Gentiles, and in every place Incenſe ſhall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering.</hi> This pure offering <hi>Job</hi> intends when he ſaith, <hi>My prayer is pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under theſe two, <hi>There is no injuſtice in my hand, and my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is pure: Job</hi> conteines the whole duty of man, both to God and to man: Here is Juſtice comprehending the dutyes of the ſecond Table,<note place="margin">His duobus membris u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramque tabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> and Prayer comprehending the duties of the firſt Table: Thus <hi>Job</hi> was compleat in all the will of God, and had reſpect to all his Commandements. And thus he verified Gods teſtimony of him (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.) and approved himſelfe to be <hi>A man perfect and upright, fearing God, and eſchewing evill,</hi> which is the whole duty of man.</p>
                  <p>From the words in generall, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Man hath great ſupport in bearing afflictions, from the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which his heart gives of his owne integrity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis matter of wonder that ever <hi>Job</hi> ſhould beare ſo many
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48478:169"/> burdens, and endure breach upon breach, till wee remember that though he had many breaches upon his body and eſtate; yet he had none upon his conſcience: Indeed his ſpirit had breaches by way of tryall and temptation from God; but it had none by way of diſobedience againſt God. <hi>The ſpirit of a man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, will ſuſtaine his infirmities (Prov.</hi> 18.14.) There are two ſorts of infirmities.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Sinfull infirmities, ſuch are impatience, doubtings, deadneſſe of heart, and vanity of thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Penall, or painefull infirmities, ſuch as are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, ſickneſſe, diſeaſes, or any outward croſſe whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Theſe latter are the infirmities which <hi>Solomon</hi> meanes; and theſe the ſpirit of a man will ſuſtaine, even while his fleſh or body ſinks under them: Yet here ſpirit is not taken meerely in oppoſition to bodily, or materiall fleſh (though the ſpirit under that Phyſicall notion is able to beare much more then the body can) but as ſpirit is oppoſed to ſpirituall and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fleſh; that is, to a carnall corrupt minde: The ſpirit of a man furniſhed with grace, ſupported with the favour of God, and the teſtimony of a good conſcience, will ſuſtaine all his infirmities; that is, cauſe him to beare with much, not onely patience, but courage and cheerfulneſſe the heavieſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of affliction, which eyther the wiſedome of God doth, or the malice of man can lay upon him. Holineſſe makes the weake ſtrong, and the ſtrong like Giants, to endure all ſhocks of trouble and hardſhip. A whole skin feeles no ſmart, though you bath it with brine; and if a man have a ſound conſcience, if his ſpirit be not galled and raw, he is able to ſtand at any time, and ſometimes to rejoyce in the ſalteſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of worldly ſorrow. For though he be not (as was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) ſenſleſſe of, or without outward ſmart; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no inward ſmart (which is the worſt ſmart) hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it: The paines and wants of the body are almoſt loſt, and ſwallowed up in the comforts and enjoyments of the minde. A wounded ſpirit who can beare? A ſpirit unwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what can it not beare? He that hath no injuſtice in his hands hath much peace in his heart, and while our prayer is pure, our ſpirits will not be much troubled in any of our troubles.</p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:48478:169"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is poſſible to live without any knowne ſin.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> knew of no injuſtice in his hand, nor was he conſcious of any impurity in his prayer. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> writes to Saints of all Ages and Statures, under the title of <hi>His little Children, not to ſin</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1.) And in that he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admoniſh them of what they ought not to doe, but of what they might attain not to doe: For though, <hi>he that ſaith he hath no ſin, deceives himſelfe,</hi> and ſins in ſaying ſo (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.) yet it may be ſayd of ſome without ſin, and they (in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe) may ſay it of themſelves without ſin, that <hi>they ſin not.</hi> The beſt Saints have, and know they have ſin in their natures and ſin in their lives, yea, and ſometimes they fall into great ſins; yet ſuch a degree of holineſſe is attaineable in this life that a man may be ſayd, <hi>not to ſin:</hi> For then (in a Goſpell ſenſe) we are ſayd not to ſin, when we caſt off and are free from all groſſe and ſcandalous ſins, and doe both carefully avoyd and make conſcience of the leaſt and the moſt ſecret ſin. <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth (Luke</hi> 1.16.) <hi>were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandements and Ordinances of the Lord blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe;</hi> that is, They did not live in any open or knowne ſin; they lived ſo, that no man could blame them, or bring any juſt complaint againſt them, eyther in matters of morality, which ſeeme to be meant in the word <hi>Commandement,</hi> or in matters of worſhip, which ſeeme to be meant by the word <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</hi> And when I ſpeak of not living in any knowne ſin, I meane not onely, that Saints may riſe ſo high as not to live in any ſin which the World takes notice of; but they may, yea and often doe arrive at that hight of holineſſe, not to live in any ſin knowne to themſelves; if once a true Beleever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers ſin, he cannot owne it, much leſſe live in it, be it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice or wrong towards men, be it any fayling in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice of God, he will not ſuffer it to lodge with him. He that hath grace in his heart, cannot live with inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in his hand; there is an inconſiſtence between theſe two, a life of grace, and to live in ſin. Sin may be much alive in him that hath grace, but he cannot live in ſin; he may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tempted to the act of it, and ſometimes poſſibly overtaken with it, yet he cannot live in it: He cannot keep injuſtice in his hand, nor frame an impure prayer in his heart. A good man
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48478:170"/> may doe an act of injuſtice, but he continues not unjuſt; he reſtores what he hath taken unjuſtly from men, and repents before the Lord; but uſually he is not conſcious to himſelfe of doing unjuſtly towards men. If a <hi>Laban</hi> (one with whom hee hath had converſe and dealing twenty yeares together) ſhould come and ſearch his houſe, he is able to ſay to him as honeſt <hi>Jacob</hi> did to his Uncle <hi>Laban (Gen.</hi> 31.37.) <hi>Whereas thou haſt ſearched all my ſtuffe, what haſt thou ſound of all thy houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuffe, ſet it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both:</hi> As if he had ſayd, Is there any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in my hand? Let it come to tryall. Or as upright <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> to all Iſrael (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3.) <hi>Behold, here I am, witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me before the Lord, and before his annoynted, whoſe Ox have I taken? Or whoſe Aſſe have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppreſſed? Samuel</hi> had been long a Judge, yet he knew of no injuſtice in his hand, neither did any man know of any, and therefore all acquit him from the leaſt blemiſh of unfaithfulneſſe in his Office (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 4.) <hi>Thou haſt not defrauded us, nor oppreſſed us, neither haſt thou taken ought</hi> (as a bribe) <hi>of any mans hand. And he ſayd unto them (Verſ.</hi> 5.) <hi>The Lord is witneſſe againſt you, and his annoynted is witneſſe this day, that yee have not found ought</hi> (that is, ought gotten unjuſtly) <hi>in my hand:</hi> That man hath reacht the perfection of juſtice, who neyther takes out of the hand of others violently, nor of the hand of others covetouſly to byas his ſpirit when hee ſits in judgement. Such a perfect Juſticer was <hi>Samuel,</hi> all Iſrael could not finde ought (ſo come by) in his hand: Hee might ſay (and he did ſay as much in effect) with <hi>Job, Not for any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in my hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as a Beleever may arrive at ſuch a blameleſſe walking towards men, that they cannot ſay, <hi>He hath ſinned;</hi> ſo at ſuch a holy walking before God, that God himſelfe will not ſay, <hi>He hath ſinned.</hi> And this God will not ſay, vvhen hee ſees a ſoule labouring (as <hi>Paul</hi> was once praying that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might) <hi>to walke worthy of the Lord, unto all pleaſing, being fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in every good worke (Col.</hi> 1.10.) And when he ſees, that his prayer is pure, and his worſhip tendered with a perfect or ſincere heart.</p>
                  <p>When a ſoule doth not wilfully neglect any duty towards God, God will ſay he hath performed all duty; and though
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48478:170"/> there may be many failings in prayer, yet God will ſay, that mans prayer is pure. So then, we grant that no man lives and ſins not, yet we affirme, that no godly man lives in ſin; and that ſome godly men are ſo farr from living in any ſin, that others cannot tax them, nor can they tax themſelves of acting any groſſe ſins; yea, though the beſt of Saints here know they ſin, and know their ſins, yet they may be ſayd not to commit knowne ſins; that is, not to ſin knowingly: He is not properly ſayd to ſin knowingly, vvho knowes he ſins, but he who ſins againſt his knowledge.</p>

                     <hi>Holineſſe conſiſts in a compleat uniformity, or in conformity to the whole will of God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> drawes the picture of a holy man, in all his limbs and lineaments; equity and purity containe all: Some are <hi>Firſt Table Chriſtians,</hi> others are <hi>Second Table Chriſtians.</hi> Some are zealous for prayer, who are extreame cold in doing Juſtice; ſome are extreame honeſt and juſt to men, righteous in all their dealings, but they care not for prayer, nor have they any delight in communion with God: The Law of God is one entire thing, and ſo muſt mans obedience be, <hi>He that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends in one poynt is guilty of all (Jam.</hi> 2.10.) For though, he that commits adultery, cannot properly be ſayd to breake that Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt doe no murder;</hi> yet whoſoever commits adultery, may properly be ſayd to break the whole Law: the reaſon is given by that Apoſtle, in the next Verſe; <hi>For he that ſayd, Doe not commit adultery, ſayd alſo, Doe not kill; now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſour of the Law.</hi> He that breakes any one linke of a chaine, breaks the chaine, though he break not a ſecond linke: 'tis ſo here, the vvhole Law is Copulative: and as in this ſenſe, the Law is one, ſo the <hi>Law-maker is altogether one:</hi> This the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> hints, as the reaſon of it, <hi>For he that ſayd, doe not commit adultery, ſayd alſo, doe not kill:</hi> As if hee had ſayd, There is one and the ſame Legiſ-lative power commanding all, and therefore, if yee tranſgreſſe one, yee tranſgreſſe all. And how can there be a ſtate of holineſſe, without an equall reſpect to both Tables of the Law, ſeeing the breach of any one Law of either Table, is, though not formally, yet redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively a breach of every Law in both Tables. And therefore
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48478:171"/>
'tis the ayme of a Beleever to fulfill both Tables of the Law, though he faile in every Law of both: hee gives up his will wholly to God, yea, he may be ſayd to loſe his will in the will of God, and this is his doing the whole will of God. And indeed wee doe nothing, unleſſe vvee be found doing all.</p>

                     <hi>If God afflict where there is no injuſtice, how juſtly doth hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe who are unjuſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shall they complaine who are beaten for their faults, when ſome are beaten who have no fault? The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> argues (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and ſinners appeare?</hi> I may alſo argue, if the righteous be not ſaved (from outward afflictions) if the godly are
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48478:171"/> ſmitten, how ſhall the ungodly and ſinners eſcape unſmitten? Many are ſmitten, not for any injuſtice in their hand (there is ſome other end, and that a juſt one, why they are ſmitten) nor is God unjuſt in ſmiting them. Now, if juſt ones are (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any injuſtice) thus ſmitten; how juſt is it with God to ſmite thoſe who are unjuſt? The repenting Theefe rebuked him that blaſphemed, and ſpake evill of Chriſt, upon this conſideration, <hi>Doſt thou not feare God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? and we juſtly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds:</hi> This man and we are in the ſame condemnation, but not in the ſame fault; we are all condemned to dye, but wee juſtly, and he unjuſtly, <hi>This man hath done nothing amiſſe,</hi> but we have done much amiſſe (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.40, 41.) Now as this Theefe was patient under his owne juſt ſufferings, ſeeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſuffer who was juſt: So when we heare that the Lord afflicts thoſe who have done no evill, how ought ſuch to lay their hands upon their mouthes, who are afflicted for the evill which they have done. <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19.) <hi>that whatſoever the Law ſaith</hi> (in a way of threatning) <hi>it ſaith to them who are under the Law</hi> (that is, who are not onely under it, as having heard the precept of the Law, but are under it alſo, as having by ſin deſerved the penalty of it) <hi>that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the World become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God;</hi> or, <hi>ſubject to the judgement of God,</hi> not having a word to object why ſentence ſhould not be executed, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed.</p>
                  <q>My prayer is pure.</q>
                  <p>Taking prayer either for the worſhip of God in generall, or for that ſpeciall duty of calling upon the name of God: Note from it,</p>
                  <p>That,</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Pure prayer is pleaſing to the pure God, and no other can pleaſe him.

                     </note> how much more doth the holy God require pure worſhip?</p>
                  <p>But what is it which denominates <hi>prayer pure,</hi> or when is prayer pure?</p>
                  <p>Prayer is pure:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When it is directed to a right object, when we pray to God, and to God onely: It is the ſole priviledge of God to receive prayer; <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, to thee ſhall all fleſh come:</hi> There is but one hearer of prayer, and that is God. <hi>Daniel</hi> withſtood the Decree of the King, when he forbad him to make his prayers to God; he would rather be caſt to the Lyons, then not to pray, or pray to any beſides God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he opened his window (to let them ſee his reſolution) and prayed to God thrice a day openly. We may petition living men, but we muſt pray onely to <hi>the living God.</hi> All men (except ſuch as have ſinned unto death) are to be prayed for, but no man muſt be prayed unto: Neither Saint, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, nor any Creature, are the object of prayer, but God alone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Pure prayer muſt be right in the matter of it, as well as the object; if we pray for that which is unlawfull, our prayer muſt needs be unlawfull; as it is a ſin to doe any thing which God commands not, ſo it is a ſin to aske any thing which God allows not. God hath ſet ſpeciall bounds to three things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, To our Faith, he teacheth us what to beleeve.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, To our actions, he teacheth us what to doe.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, To our prayers, he teacheth us what to deſire.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>We may make enlarged prayers, but we are not left at large in prayer. <hi>The ſquare or rule of prayer, is the will of God</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14.) <hi>And this is the confidence that we have in him, if we aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> The will of God is the rule, not onely of things to be done by us, but of things which we are to aske God, to doe for us: As man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally would rather doe, ſo he would rather have his owne will, then the will of God. Man would faine be his owne carver, but God will not let him: It pleaſes man better to goe two mile upon his owne errand, then one upon Gods er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand; and it pleaſes man better to have any one thing of his owne chuſing, then two of Gods chuſing; but it ſhould not.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48478:172"/> The will of God under a threefold revelation is the rule and matter of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The will of God in commandements; whatſoever God hath charged upon us to doe, wee may pray for power and ſtrength to doe it, or that it may be done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The will of God in Promiſes; what God hath ſayd he will give, we may pray to receive.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The will of God in Propheſies; what God hath foreſhewed ſhall come to paſſe, we muſt pray that it may come to paſſe. The prayer of man gives birth to the Propheſies of God. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael, to doe it for them (Ezek.</hi> 36.37.) God is a ſure pay-maſter, yet he expects we ſhould ſue him, before he payes. <hi>Daniel</hi> found by Books, that the time drew nigh, for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Jews out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and then (ſaith he) <hi>I ſet my face unto the Lord God, to ſeek by prayer and ſupplications, with faſting, ſack-cloth, and aſhes (Dan.</hi> 9.1, 2.) The manifeſtation of the will of God in a Propheſie, is a ſtrong ground of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Thus the matter of prayer, is the will of God under one of thoſe three manifeſtations, a Command, a Promiſe, or a Propheſie.</p>
                  <p>A third thing in pure prayer, is the forme of it. There is a twofold forme of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The internall, or eſſentiall forme.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The externall, or accidentall forme of prayer.</p>
                  <p>The externall forme, is that habit of words and expreſſions with which we cloath our deſires, when we preſent them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: This forme varies, not onely according to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall occaſions and emergencies of this life, which call us to the duty of prayer, but alſo according to the ſeverall gifts and abilities of thoſe who pray. We are free as to this forme, from all tyes and preſcriptions, except this, that wee utter our mindes to God ſoberly, gravely, ſpiritually, with an eye to thoſe formes and patternes of wholeſome words delivered to us in the word of God; and eſpecially to that part of the word which Chriſt gave both as a compendium, and a copy of holy prayer.</p>
                  <p>But as for the eſſentiall and internall forme of prayer, that is unchangeable, and muſt ever be one and the ſame: Namely, <hi>That we pray in the name of Chriſt.</hi> One of the Ancients was
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48478:173"/> much delighted in reading <hi>Tullies Hortenſius,</hi> yet this at laſt abated the edge of his delight in it, <hi>That he did not finde the name of Chriſt in it.</hi> As the Name of Chriſt is the greateſt ornament of all Books where it is;<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Confeſſ. cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> ſo <hi>the name of Chriſt is the eſſence of all prayers; and that is no prayer, where his Name is not. (John</hi> 14.13.) <hi>Whatſoever yee aske in my Name, I will doe it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son: whatſoever yee doe, doe all in the Nome of Chriſt, giving thanks to God, through him (Col.</hi> 3.17.) To pray in the Name of Chriſt, is more then to name Chriſt in prayer: <hi>It is eaſie to name Chriſt in prayer, but it is a hard thing to pray in the Name of Chriſt.</hi> To pray in the Name of Chriſt, is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To looke up to Chriſt, as having purchaſed us this priviledge, that we may pray; for it is by the blood of Chriſt that vve draw neere to God, and that a Throne of grace is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To pray in the Name of Chriſt, is to pray in the ſtrength of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To pray in the Name of Chriſt, is to pray in the vertue of the preſent mediation of Chriſt, vvhich carries this acknowledgement in it, <hi>That what we aske on earth, Chriſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To pray thus is no eaſie matter, and unleſſe vve pray thus, vve doe not pray at all. (<hi>John</hi> 16.23, 24.) <hi>In that day yee ſhall aske me nothing: Verily I ſay unto you, what ſoever yee ſhall aske the Father in my Name, hee will give it you. Hitherto have yee asked nothing in my Name, aske and yee ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</hi> But how doe theſe parts of the Text conſiſt? Why doth Chriſt tell them, that they ſhall aske nothing in that day, and yet promiſe, that vvhat they aske hee vvill give? There is a twofold asking.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, By vvay of Queſtion.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, By way of Petition.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The former, is asking, that vve may know, or be informed in vvhat vve doubt; the latter, is asking, that vve may receive and be ſupplyed vvith vvhat wee vvant. Now, vvhen Chriſt ſaith, <hi>In that day yee ſhall aske me nothing:</hi> he had a little before promiſed ſuch a manifeſtation of the minde of God to them, by the ſpirit, that they ſhould not need to come and aske him; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Now yee put queſtions</hi> (as vve read they did) <hi>about many things, yee underſtand little of the myſtery of the Goſpel;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48478:173"/> but in that day yee ſhall have ſo cleere a revelation about the things of Heaven, that yee ſhall not need to propoſe your doubts, and deſire reſolution, for you ſhall be able to reſolve your ſelves by the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you.</hi> This the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> (1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.20.) tels the Saints, <hi>But yee have an unction from the holy one, and yee know all things:</hi> And againe (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 27.) <hi>But the annoynting which yee have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, abideth in you: and yee need not that any man ſhould teach you: but as the ſame annoynting teacheth you all things, and is truth, and is no lye; and even as it hath taught, yee ſhall abide in him.</hi> Theſe Scriptures are both a cleere expoſition, and an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous verification of that promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>In that day yee ſhall aske me nothing:</hi> that is, After my reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>But when he ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever yee aske the Father in my Name, he will give it:</hi> the meaning is, Your prayers ſhall be heard, vvhile you keep cloſe to this eſſentiall forme, <hi>Asking in my Name.</hi> Beſides this eſſentiall forme of prayer, there is alſo another forme, vvhich we may call in a quallified ſenſe, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall: As vvhen the matter wee pray about is ſpirituall, and abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, then to pray in an abſolute forme. If it be temporall, and outward, or if it be of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nature, yet ſuch as is onely neceſſary to the vvel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Beleever, as ſpirituall gifts, yea, and the degrees of grace are, then to pray in a conditionall forme, as ſubmitting it to the will of God, not onely for the time, and manner, and meanes, and meaſure vvherein, or by vvhich wee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe things, but alſo ſubmitting the very things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his good pleaſure, vvhether we ſhall receive them at all, or no. Nor doth conditionall prayer hinder Faith, but looks to the rule. We may pray without doubting, though we pray vvith a condition; and vvhen we are fulleſt of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, vvee may be fulleſt of confidence; yea, without ſubmiſſion in thoſe caſes, there can be no true confidence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Prayer is pure, when the end vvhich we ayme at is pure: The end denominates every action, as to the quality or goodneſſe of it. The great end of prayer, as of all other actions, and vvithout vvhich, neither thoſe, nor this, can be called <hi>pure,</hi> is, <hi>the glory of God. Hallowed be thy name,</hi> is the firſt prayer, and that hath influence into all our prayers: we muſt pray for all, that God may be glorified, and pray for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that our luſts may be ſatisfied. Though wee may pray
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48478:174"/> that our vvants may be ſupplyed (that may be an end) yet never that our luſts may be ſatisfied (<hi>James</hi> 4.3.) <hi>Yee aske and receive not, becauſe yee aske amiſſe:</hi> Where vvas the fault vvhich the Apoſtle found, and ſpecified in thoſe prayers? Not in the object, they prayed to God; not in the matter, they prayed for things lawfull; not in the forme, they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Name of Chriſt; but the fault was in the end, yee aske amiſſe, <hi>that yee may beſtow it on your luſts.</hi> It is poſſible for a man to pray, not onely for evill things, but for good things, and not onely for outward good things, but for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good things, to beſtow upon his luſts; ſome pray for ſpirituall gifts, to beſtow them on their luſts, pride, vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, and covetouſneſſe; yea, it is poſſible for a man to pray for grace, to beſtow it on his luſt (ſo Hypocrites doe) though it be impoſſible for any man, who indeed receives grace, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it upon his luſt: Let your end be pure, that your prayers may be pure alſo.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Prayer is pure when it is mingled with, <hi>and put up in Faith. By Faith Abel offered a more excellent ſacrifice then Cain (Heb.</hi> 11.4.) and <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God (Verſ.</hi> 6.) Prayer is our comming to God, <hi>He that comes to God, muſt beleeve that God is, and that hee is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Faith takes hold of Chriſt, by whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our prayers are purified; and therfore there can be no pure prayer without Faith. As God purifies our hearts by faith, ſo our prayers are purified by Faith. Faith doth not onely take hold of God for the granting of our prayer, in which ſenſe 'tis ſaid (<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>If any one aske, let him aske in Faith;</hi> that is, That he ſhall receive: but Faith takes hold of Chriſt for the purifying of our prayer, that ſo it may come up with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance before God. <hi>Hee is of purer eyes then to behold evill, he cannot looke on iniquity</hi> (to approve of it, or to like it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13.) Seeing then there is much iniquity in our holy things, we muſt doe all by our High Prieſt, who (as the typical High Prieſt, did for the Children of Iſrael (<hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38.) beares the iniquity of our holy things, that we (as they) may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>That, and onely that, is pure prayer, which is breathed in, and breathed out, by the ſpirit of God. Edifie your ſelves in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48478:174"/> 
                     <hi>praying by the holy Ghoſt</hi> (as ſome tranſlate) that is, by the ſtrength and helpe of the holy Ghoſt. We cannot make pure prayer with our owne breath, parts, and gifts; the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit breathes holy prayer into, and draws it out of our hearts: As we know not what to beleeve or doe aright, till the ſpirit teacheth us; ſo <hi>we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the ſpirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for us (Rom.</hi> 8.26.) The ſpirit maketh interceſſion, not as Chriſt doth; the ſpirit doth not mediate between God and us; but as it is the office of Chriſt to intercede for us with God, ſo it is the office of the holy Ghoſt to make thoſe interceſſions in us, which we put up to God: So that the ſpirit is ſaid to make interceſſion for us, becauſe the interceſſions and prayers which we make, are made by the ſpirit; the ſpirit formes them in us. As ſome duller Schollers in a Schoole, who cannot make their Exerciſes, get their exerciſes made for them by thoſe that are more pregnant; ſo the ſpirit makes interceſſion for us. We are dull, and low,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and ſtraitned, wee cannot make a prayer, the ſpirit makes them for us in our hearts: Hence it is ſaid in the beginning of the Verſe, <hi>The ſpirit alſo helpeth our infirmities:</hi> The Greek word ſignifieth to helpe, as a Nurſe helpeth a little Childe to goe, or as a weake decrepid old man is upholden by a ſtaffe, or rather (as the compoſition of the word implyes) <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit helpeth together:</hi> And then it is a Metaphor taken from thoſe who lift a weight, or a peece of Timber (too heavy for one) together: The ſpirit lends us his hand in this duty, and they who have received grace, act alſo with the ſpirit: Thus, the <hi>ſpirit helpeth together:</hi> The Spirit and a Beleever are both at it, to carry on this praying worke; yet all that ſtrength which we put to the worke flowes from the ſpirit; who as he raiſeth us when wee are quite fallen, ſo hee aſſiſts us when we are raiſed, and then wee make good worke, pure worke of it in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>That is a pure prayer which comes from a pure perſon:</hi> And there is a double purity of the perſon neceſſary to a pure prayer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is the purity of his ſtate; he muſt be a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and regenerated perſon, otherwiſe his prayer is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though he ſhould be right in as many of the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned requiſites, as it is poſſible for an unregenerate man to be;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48478:175"/> as ſuppoſe he not onely prayeth to God, and for ſuch things as are agreeable to the will of God, but alſo (as he thinks) for the glory of God; yet the mans prayer is impure, becauſe himſelfe is impure: God hath reſpect to the perſon, before he hath reſpect to his ſupplication. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8.) <hi>The prayer of the wicked is an abomination to God; but the prayer of the upright is his delight:</hi> And againe, <hi>Hee that turnes away his eare from hearing the Law, even his prayer ſhall bee abomination (Prov.</hi> 28.9.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As there muſt be purity of ſtate, before there can be a pure prayer, ſo alſo purity of life, that is, he muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in purity, not lying or continuing in any ſin (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrath and doubtings. Holy hands,</hi> note the purity of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as a <hi>holy heart</hi> notes the purity of our ſtate: To lift up the hands is to pray, the ſigne being put for the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: The meaning is, let your prayers be holy. Firſt, <hi>without wrath</hi> to men; come not to ſeeke the favour of God, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and revenge in thy heart againſt man: Secondly, pray <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting;</hi> that reſpects God, and is oppoſed to Faith: As if the Apoſtle had ſayd, Pray both in actuall Faith and Love. Yet the Greek word (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) there uſed, is rendered by ſome, Diſceptation, or wrangling; as if the Apoſtle had in that ſpecified one effect of wrath. 'Tis expounded alſo by others, for any internall diſtraction, or diſtemper of the mind; for the minde of man is often carryed away from God in prayer, and maintaines ſecret Dialogiſmes, diſcourſes, and conferences, in, and with it ſelfe, when it ſhould be wholly taken up with God.</p>
                  <p>The covetous mans heart talkes of Gold, and the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous mans heart talkes of pleaſures, when hee ſeemes to pray: yea, theſe Foules will often come downe upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of an <hi>Abraham,</hi> onely as ſoone as hee eſpies them, hee drives them away; yet by theſe interruptions in prayer, as well as by any ſinfull action unrepented of, before, prayer, the holineſſe of prayer, or the lifting up of holy hands in prayer, is hindred and defaced, even in thoſe, whoſe perſons are holy. <hi>David</hi> was a man that was pure in ſtate, he was a converted perſon; yet he ſaith (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 66.18.) <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not heare my prayers.</hi> Though I
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48478:175"/> am pure in ſtate, yet if I am impure in life, the eare of God will ſhut againſt my ſuites (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.14, 15.) God rejects the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his owne people, becauſe their hands were full of blood, and hence his counſell, <hi>Waſh you, make you cleane, put away the evill of your doings from before mine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Come now let us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon together; ſaith the Lord (Verſ.</hi> 18.) As if he had ſaid, while I ſee your ſins, I cannot heare your prayers; while your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are before mine eyes, your ſupplications cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into mine eare, nor will I anſwer them. How can any ſoule expect with Faith, that God ſhould doe what he requeſts, when hee will not doe what God commands? Or that God ſhould fulfill our deſires, while wee in any thing neglect his rules?</p>
                  <p>As the prayer of an unholy perſon is turned into ſin, ſo the ſin of a holy perſon may cauſe the Lord to turne away his prayer: Then take that counſell of the Apoſtle, writing to, and of Saints (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22.) <hi>Let us draw nigh to God with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water:</hi> There is a twofold evill conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That which lives in any knowne ſinne unrepented of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That which is unquiet and unſetled about the pardon of thoſe ſins which we have repented of.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould get both theſe evil conſciences, but eſpecially the firſt, cured and removed by the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt, before we draw nigh to God in prayer: as alſo <hi>our bodies waſhed in pure water,</hi> which is either an alluſion to the old Ceremonies among the Jewes, who before they came to worſhip at the Tabernacle, purged themſelves with diverſe outward waſhings, leading them to the conſideration of that morall puritie, both of heart and life, in which God is to be worſhipped; or it is an alluſion to Baptiſme in ſpeciall; in which there is an externall waſhing of the body, ſignifying the waſhing of the ſoule by the blood of Chriſt, and by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall working of the ſpirit; The ſum of all is, unleſſe the perſon be pure, his prayer is not pure. Theſe are the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients which conſtitute pure prayer; all theſe met in <hi>Job,</hi> and therefore he concluded, not onely confidently, but truely, <hi>My prayer is pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:48478:176"/>
                  <p>And as theſe are the ingredients of prayer, ſo they are all neceſſary ingredients; ſo neceſſary that if any one of them be wanting, the whole prayer is impure: They are neceſſary by a double neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As commanded by God in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As meanes without which man cannot attaine his end in prayer.</p>
                  <p>The generall end of prayer, is, that prayer may be heard, accepted, and anſwered; God heares, accepts, anſwers, no one prayer, without ſome concurrence of all theſe. The Incenſe of the Ceremoniall Law was a ſhadow of prayer, which is ſo great a duty of the morall Law: But if this Incenſe had not been made exactly according to the will of God, both for the matter and the manner of the compoſition, preſcribed (<hi>Exod.</hi> 30.34, 35, 36.) If after it had been thus made, it had not alſo been offered according to thoſe rules given (<hi>Levit.</hi> 16.12, 13.) it had been <hi>an abomination to the Lord;</hi> or as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Chap.</hi> 66.3.) <hi>Such a burning of Incenſe had been but as the bleſſing of an Idol.</hi> We may conclude alſo, That, if prayer be either compoſed, or preſented in any other way then God himſelfe hath directed, it is not onely turned away, but turned into ſin. <hi>That man hath ſpoken a great word, who can ſay (in Jobs ſenſe) My prayer is pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Job</hi> juſtifies the prayer he made to God, and maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines his juſtice towards men. <hi>There is no injuſtice in my hands, alſo my prayer is pure:</hi> A high profeſſion, yet in the next words he goes higher, and makes both an imprecation againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe if it were not thus with him, and an appeale to God for his teſtimony, that it was thus with him.</p>

                  <q>O earth, cover not my [blood.]</q>
                  <p>But what is his <hi>[blood]</hi> which he would not have covered? His blood may be taken two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Paſſively, for his ſufferings and grievous afflictions, which were even to blood: The Apoſtle tels the Hebrews, <hi>Ye have not reſiſted to blood, ſtriving againſt ſin (Heb.</hi> 12.4.) There is a threefold ſtrife againſt ſin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Againſt ſin already acting and moving in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a ſtriving againſt that ſin which others move us to act, whether by promiſes, or by threatnings.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a ſtriving againſt that ſin which others act.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle (as I conceive) intends one of, or both the latter ſorts of ſtriving againſt ſin, which is indeed a ſtriving againſt ſinners; and in this ſtrife he ſaith, <hi>Ye have not reſiſted unto blood;</hi> yee have (I grant) reſiſted, to the loſſe of your goods, yea, and to the loſſe of your credit and reputation in the World (<hi>Chap.</hi> 10.33, 34.) but know, yee are not come to the heat of the Battell, till your bodies bleed:<note place="margin">Ne tegas ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem meum. <hi>i. e.</hi> injuriam mihi latam qua innocens pereo. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> yee have loſt no blood yet, <hi>ſtriving againſt ſin. Job</hi> reſiſted, or rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to blood; he had loſt blood, in the great fight of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he indured; hee was wounded all over. Now, ſay ſome, he cryes, <hi>O earth, cover not my blood;</hi> that is, Theſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48478:178"/> my bloody ſufferings; what I have endured, let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. But we cannot well accommodate this interpretation to the Text: For, firſt, there may be as much vanity in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the evils wee have ſuffered, as the good wee have done ſhould be knowne: we muſt let God alone to erect the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of our ſufferings; that muſt be none of our care.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wee cannot ſo much as ſuſpect that <hi>Job</hi> would maintaine the memory of his ſufferings againſt God; yet it was he who ſmote <hi>Job,</hi> though by the hand of Satan, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men: This <hi>Job</hi> had acknowledged more then once, with much humble ſubmiſſion, and therefore hee doth not deſire that his blood might be forth-comming in a way of conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him. Further, If we looke onely to thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his affliction, who had indeed done him wrong: Surely the ſpirit of this good man, as it was farr from medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating revenge, ſo his ſcope and buſineſſe here, was rather to bring himſelfe to a tryall then them, rather to have his owne innocency cleered, then their guilt proved: And therefore we have called theſe words, an imprecation upon himſelfe, in caſe he were guilty, not an accuſation of their guiltineſſe. In purſuance of which generall ſenſe, we muſt expound blood under another notion. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Blood may be taken actively, and ſo it falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a threefold conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Blood is put for the generall ſinfulneſſe or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans nature, as alſo for any particular ſin, as it is wrapt up in mans naturall corruption.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> One of the Ancients in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets <hi>Davids</hi> prayer (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.14.) <hi>Deliver me from blood, or bloods,</hi> or (as we render) <hi>from blood-guiltineſſe, O God;</hi> not of that ſpeciall ſin, or not of that onely, the death of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> but of all ſin, which (ſaith he) therefore beares that title, becauſe it flowes from the polluted nature of man, which the Scripture calls fleſh and blood. That of the Prophet is more proper to this point (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6.) <hi>When thou waſt in thy blood, I ſayd unto thee live:</hi> that is, When thou was wrapt in, and defiled with thy ſin and miſery, then I had pitty on thee, and ſpake life into thee. Every ſoule tumbles in blood till it is ſprinkled with blood; our blood is our filthineſſe, and the blood of Chriſt is our holineſſe, freeing us at once from the guilt, and from the ſtaine of ſin. This corruption of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48478:178"/> nature, together with that iſſue of it, the tranſgreſſions of life may be called bloud, for two reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe it deſerves death, and is a ſtate of death, wee are dead in ſin, and <hi>the wages of ſin is death;</hi> and as any kinde of death may be expreſſed by blood, ſo a violent death is the pouring out of blood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may be called blood, becauſe ſin is expiated by blood, and <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion;</hi> no not of the leaſt ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Blood</hi> ſignifies ſome notorious ſin or ſins. Great ſins are not onely bloody ſins,<note place="margin">Sanguinis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur peccatum graviſſimum, ac deteſtandum facinus.</note> but (in Scripture language) blood. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>When yee make many prayers, I will not heare:</hi> Why? <hi>For your hands are full of blood;</hi> that is, Of great and foule crimes: For ſhould wee take blood there, for any ſin, according to the former interpretation, then whoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall be heard? Who is it that ſins not, yea, who is not full of ſin? So that by <hi>hands full of blood,</hi> he meanes hands ſtained with great ſins; or with ſins, if ſmall in themſelves, yet, (which greatens the leaſt ſin) loved and unrepented of (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.9.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, The iniquity of the Houſe of Iſrael, and Judah, is exceeding great, and the Land is full of blood;</hi> that is, Of all kinde of wickedneſſe (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.7.) <hi>For her blood is in the middeſt of her, ſhee ſet it upon the top of a rock, ſhee pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it not upon the ground, to cover it with duſt:</hi> Which words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, as the ſin of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo her impudence in ſinning. <hi>Her blood was in the midſt of her,</hi> it was not caſt behinde the doore, or put into a corner, <hi>Shee ſet it upon a rock,</hi> and not onely ſo, but upon <hi>the top of a rock;</hi> as if ſhee not onely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not who ſaw it, but had taken care that all might ſee it, <hi>Shee poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with duſt:</hi> In which words the Prophet alludes to that Law (<hi>Levit.</hi> 17.13.) commanding that the blood of a Beaſt ſhould be poured out, and covered with duſt. And againe (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.2.) <hi>By ſwearing, and killing, and ſtealing, and committing adultery; they breake out, and blood toucheth blood;</hi> that is, One wickedneſſe is heaped upon another. There is an aggregation,<note place="margin">Aggr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> or a combination of many ſins together, their ſins are ſo thick ſet, that there is not the leaſt ſpace, eyther of time or place betweene them; they ſin continually, and they ſin contiguouſly, ſin touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſin.</p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:48478:179"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, By <hi>blood</hi> in this active ſenſe, we may underſtand thoſe ſpeciall ſins which draw blood; the ſin of oppreſſion, and the ſin of murder. The Scriptures laſt cited, include theſe principally, though not theſe alone, or not theſe excluſively to other ſins. Sins of cruelty are often called blood by name, and ſuch are named bloody men, who commit ſuch ſins (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.24.) <hi>Blood-thirſty and deceitfull men ſhall not live out halfe their dayes;</hi> that is, Murderers, and Oppreſſours ſhall not. When <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed <hi>David,</hi> he ſayd, <hi>Goe thou bloody man, thou Son of Belial</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7, 8.) He calls him bloody man, in reference to that particular act, with which <hi>David</hi> had ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hands, <hi>the murder of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah. (Hab.</hi> 2.12.) <hi>Woe to him that buildeth a Towne with blood, that ſtabliſheth a City with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> that is, By the iniquity of oppreſſion: Hee builds with blood, who to ſet his owne neſt on high, throwes downe the right, or takes away the lives of others. Under this third, as alſo the ſecond notion of blood, wee may beſt interpret <hi>Jobs</hi> imprecation, <hi>O earth, cover not thou my blood:</hi> that is, The oppreſſions and cruelties which I have committed, if I have committed any. Some conceive that <hi>Job</hi> referrs to the ſtory of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel (Gen.</hi> 4.10.) The earth would not cover <hi>Cains</hi> blood; that is, the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> which <hi>Cain</hi> had ſpilt. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> told <hi>Job</hi> before in a third perſon, that his Tabernacle was a <hi>Tabernacle of bribery;</hi> as much as to ſay, That hee had done wrong in his place,<note place="margin">Si quam caedem maleficiumvè quod objicitis patravi, illud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velet &amp; teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetur terra. <hi>Jun.</hi> O Tellus ne ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſcelera mea capitalia. <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur.</hi>
                     </note> and had been a grinder of the faces of the poore. Now ſaith <hi>Job, O earth, cover not my blood,</hi> if I have been an oppreſſour, if I have drank the blood of the poore, or am guilty of ſuch like abominations, I deſire that the earth would not cover, or diſſemble it, but let it be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to my ſhame, and brought forth to my judgement. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Broughtons</hi> note is full to this ſenſe, <hi>If there be any injury in my hands, let the earth reveale it.</hi> And the Tygurine, <hi>O earth doe not conceale my capitall crimes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond branch of the imprecation fals croſſe to this; for in this <hi>Job</hi> prayes, that his evill deeds might be diſcovered, in that he prays that his very prayers (which were his beſt deeds) might not be accepted, if he had eyther been, or done as was ſuſpected.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:48478:179"/>And let my cry have no place.</q>
                  <p>The word ſignifies a loud cry, a greevous cry, the cry of a man extreamely preſſed; yea, even utterly oppreſt: This cry is expounded three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the very cry of griefe, or for a cry cauſed meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by griefe. <hi>Let my cry have no place;</hi> that is, Let not my paines and ſorrows, my groanes and ſighes, in midſt of all theſe evills be regarded, either by God or Men, if I have done ſuch evils as I am accuſed of. 'Tis a great affliction which puts a man to his cry, whether to God or Man; but it is a greater affliction to cry and not to be heard, neither by God nor man: The cry of a poore man is then ſaid to have no place with a Judge, when he will not heare it, or take notice of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others expound this for the cry of ſin. Great ſins are called a cry, not onely becauſe they make others cry, but becauſe themſelves are very clamarous and crying.<note place="margin">Clamat quia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocens effuſus eſt, &amp; dicitur inter pellare do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutione Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quii ſed indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate commiſſi. <hi>Ambroſ.</hi>
                     </note> Sin hath a tongue to ſpeake, and it hath teeth to bite: every ſin ſpeakes, but ſome ſins have a loud voice, they cry, <hi>The blood of thy Brother which thou haſt ſpilt, cryes unto me</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.10.) The ſin of <hi>Sodome</hi> cryed up to Heaven (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.20.) Oppreſſion cauſeth a cry; ſo here, <hi>Let my cry,</hi> that is, my crying ſins, or the cry of my ſins, <hi>have no place;</hi> that is, none to hide, or ſhelter themſelves in: And then this clauſe of the imprecation is of the ſame ſenſe with the former, <hi>O earth, cover not thou my blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By this cry we may underſtand <hi>Jobs</hi> prayer, and that of two ſorts: Firſt, Prayers, Petitions, or complaints to men; let not any Freind regard my cry. Secondly, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God; for as there are crying ſins, ſo there are crying prayers, <hi>The Lord ſayd to Moſes, Wherefore cryeſt thou unto mee (Exod.</hi> 14.15.) <hi>Aſa</hi> cryed unto the Lord (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.) The <hi>Ninevites</hi> were commanded to cry mightily to God (<hi>John</hi> 3.8.) and Chriſt himſelfe prayed with ſtrong cryes (<hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.) As there are two things eſpecially which make ſins crying ſins,

                     </note>We find <hi>David</hi> often crying to God in prayer; ſo that, when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let my cry have no place,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>Let not God hear my moſt earneſt prayer:</hi> A dreadfull imprecation! When wee who have no helpe on earth, ſhall wiſh that we may have none in Heaven neither; what can wee wiſh worſe to our ſelves then this?</p>
                  <p>From the words in generall, Obſerve.</p>

                     <hi>It is lawfull to uſe imprecations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> did not ſin in this; There are imprecations of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Upon others, when we wiſh them evill, or curſe them; this in ſome rare caſes may be done, <hi>David</hi> uſeth impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the incorrigible enemies of the Church, and ſo may we; but in reference to perſonall injuries, the Goſpel-rule is, <hi>Bleſſe them that curſe you, pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you (Matth.</hi> 5.44.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Upon our ſelves; ſuch are the imprecations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this point. <hi>Job</hi> cals downe miſcheife upon his owne head, in both parts of the Verſe, <hi>Let all my ſins be diſcovered, let all my prayers be refuſed, if ever I have done this thing.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations, or wiſhes of evill upon our ſelves may proceed upon a double ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the aſſuring of what we promiſe, or engage our ſelves to doe: As to ſay, <hi>I will doe ſuch a thing, or I promiſe to doe it; if I doe it not, I wiſh evill may befall me:</hi> This is to put our ſelves under a curſe, which we doe at leaſt implicitely in taking any promiſſory Oath. There are two ſorts of Oaths.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Aſſertory Oaths, when we affirme ſuch a thing to be true.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Promiſſory Oaths, when wee promiſe to doe ſuch a thing, calling God to witneſſe, and laying our ſelves under a penalty, if we doe it not. This is expreſſed in ſome, and implyed in all ſolemne Oaths and Covenants. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent point extends not to this ſort of imprecations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Imprecations of penall evills may be uſed for the ſtronger deniall, or diſavowing of any ſinfull evill, of which we are ſuſpected, or with which we are directly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48478:180"/> To this ſort of imprecations the preſent point is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: This was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, he was deeply charged to have done wickedly, and he as deeply denied that he had done ſo. Thus <hi>David</hi> imprecates evill upon himſelfe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5.) The title of the Pſalme ſhewes the occaſion of it. <hi>Shiggaion of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (that is, <hi>Davids</hi> variable, or delightfull ſong, or <hi>Davids</hi> ſolace) <hi>concerning the words of Cuſh the Benjamite:</hi> that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe, whoſe ill diſpoſition towards him, he cloſely taxeth under the word <hi>Cuſh,</hi> which ſignifies a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moore, or Aethiopian; or it may deſigne ſome of <hi>Sauls</hi> Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who had done ill offices to <hi>David,</hi> and accuſed him of a conſpiracie, to take away <hi>Sauls</hi> life, as appeares (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.9.) <hi>And David ſayd to Saul, Wherefore heareſt thou mens words, ſaying, Behold David ſeeketh thy hurt.</hi> Now <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this Pſalme in his owne vindication, and feares not to call downe vengeance upon his owne head, if he were guilty. <hi>O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hands</hi> (that is, this iniquitie, if I have done this) <hi>If I have rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded evill to him that was at peace with me</hi> (what then? Hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precates) <hi>Let mine enemy perſecute my ſoule and take it, yea let him tread my life downe to the earth, and lay mine honour in the duſt. David</hi> laies all at ſtake, ſoule, and life, and honour, in the higheſt actings of holineſſe towards God, and integritie towards man. He that is in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, and hath <hi>Davids</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, may doe the like and feare no hurt. The Woman ſuſpected of Adultery was by the Law (<hi>Num.</hi> 5.) to impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and wiſh evill on her ſelfe, if ſhee did not ſpeake true in denying it: For the Prieſt was commanded to bring the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and to put the offering on her head, and then to give her the water of jealouſie to drink, ſaying, <hi>This water which cauſeth the curſe, ſhall goe into thy bowels, to make thy belly to ſwell, and thy thigh to rot;</hi> and the Woman was to anſwer, <hi>Amen, Amen:</hi> As if ſhee had ſaid, <hi>I pray God this miſery may come upon me, in caſe I have been falſe, or unfaithfull to my Husband.</hi> Thus the Woman confirmed the curſe, and tooke it upon her ſelfe, if ſhee were defiled: or teſtified her Faith in God, that he would cleare her innocencie, ſhee being not defiled; and therefore the word <hi>Amen</hi> was doubled.</p>
                  <p>And here it will not be impertinent to remember how the ſuperſtitious heart of man hath in times of former ignorance
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48478:181"/> and darkneſſe invented and adventured upon wayes of tryall in doubtfull caſes, with ſome reſemblance to (poſſibly in imitation of) this appointment of God among the Jewes.</p>

                  <p>Theſe cuſtomes drew their firſt breath from Paganiſme, and were continued by ſome who profeſſed Chriſtianity, till clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer light convinced them of their vanitie, and unwarrantable boldneſſe with the Name of God.</p>
                  <p>Now, as all imprecations uſed with theſe or the like Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and circumſtances invented by man are wicked and unlawfull; ſo thoſe which are in themſelves lawfull, are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by moſt, unlawfully. And therefore I ſhall give ſome rules, and bounds beyond which we may not paſſe, without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preſumption.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>An imprecation muſt be uſed onely in very great, ſerious, and weighty matters:</hi> Woe to thoſe who wiſh evill on, or curſe themſelves about trifles; ſome have been heard to wiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

                  <p>Secondly, It is not enough that the matter be great, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, It muſt be done with a deſire to honour God, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>hat would be thought ſo holy, and religious before God; ſee how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious and diſloyall he is to his King.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> ſaw the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God concerned in him; He was bold to ſay, <hi>Lord if I have done this thing, let him perſecute my life and take it,</hi> he hath perſecuted my life, but he could not take it hitherto; but let him take it, if this be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Be ſure that you are cleare in the matter, and that you imprecate in truth; God is an avenger of falſhood, much more of ſtudied falſhood. It is hard to deprecate his wrath, when we have ſpoken falſly, ſurely then he will poure out his wrath upon their heads, who imprecate it, to cover their falſhood. The Jewes accuſed Chriſt falſly, and as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly prayed judgement againſt him, crying out to the Judge, <hi>Let him be crucified;</hi> But when they ſaw they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with importunity, and that <hi>Pilate</hi> (who was doubtfull of the juſtice of their clamour) tooke water, and waſhed his hands, and ſaid, <hi>Behold I am free from the blood of this man;</hi> then in a rage they imprecate, <hi>Let his blood be upon us and upon our Children (Matth.</hi> 27.25.) As if they had ſaid, Be not thou ſo ſcrupulous to condemne him, if thou thinkeſt him innocent, let the vengeance of his innocent blood, fall upon us and our poſterity. When a man is accuſed rightly, and the Judge reſts unſatisfied, the accuſer may ſay to ſatisfie the Judge, <hi>Let his blood be upon my head;</hi> I have ſpoke my conſcience, and the truth. The Jewes accuſed Chriſt falſely, yet called for his blood upon their heads; therefore God gave them their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wiſh, and they lye under the weight of this imprecation to this very day: they prayed that the blood of Chriſt might be upon them, and it is upon them. As God poures the blood of Chriſt upon ſome in mercy, ſo upon others in wrath. The blood of Chriſt is upon Beleevers, to waſh and cleanſe them
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48478:182"/> from their ſins, but the blood of Chriſt hath been upon the Jewes to condemne and ſcatter them, as a vile people, all the World over for their ſin: The Lord hath been moſt exact in anſwering this cry, even in the very place where they made it. The Hiſtory of the Jewes reports that about thirty eight years after this dreadfull curſe upon themſelves, <hi>Herod</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Jewes together, and demanded a ſumm of Money of them for making a <hi>water-courſe,</hi> which they refuſing to give, he ſent for Souldiers to come ſecretly armed, who ſlew great multitudes of them in that place, where they cryed, <hi>Let his blood be upon us, &amp;c.</hi> At another time <hi>Florus,</hi> who was Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Common Souldiers, made a ſecond, and that a more bloody maſſacre of them there. And when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> the blood of Chriſt was powred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heads of many hundred thouſands, who were ſlaine by Fire and Sword, Famine and Peſtilence; beſides more then ſeven thouſand of them, who were led Captive: And the Story informes us further, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſold the younger and common ſort of thoſe Captives at that contemptible rate of <hi>thirty a penny;</hi> as they or their Fathers ſold Chriſt for <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pence,</hi> ſo by the juſt judgement of God thirty of them were ſold for a penny. There was never any people in the World, who taſted more juſtly, or more deeply of that cup of ſelf-curſing then the Jews have done; yet many perſons have taſted deeply of it too beſides the Jewes. This ſin hath ſo much, not only of wickedneſſe, but boldneſſe in it, that God never lets it goe altogether unpuniſhed, though (being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of) it may be pardoned. Maſter <hi>Perkins, in his Booke of the right government of the tongue,</hi> touching upon this point, tels us of certaine Engliſh Souldiers in the time of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſixth, who were caſt upon the French ſhore by a ſtorme; in which ſtreſſe they went to prayer, that they might be delivered; but one Souldier in ſtead of praying, cryed out, <hi>Gallowes take thy right, or claime thy due;</hi> and when hee came home he was hanged indeed. Maſter <hi>Fox, in his Booke of Acts and Monuments,</hi> hath a notable example to this purpoſe, of one <hi>John Peters, Keeper of Newgate,</hi> who was wont at every ordinary thing he ſpoke (whether it were true or falſe, it made (with him) no great matter) to averr it with this imprecation, if it be not ſo, <hi>I pray God I may rot before I dye;</hi>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:48478:182"/> and ſo it came to paſſe. I might give many ſuch inſtances of raſh imprecations which God hath followed with ſevereſt vengeance: I ſhall add one more which is freſh in the memory of many yet living, of a <hi>Gentleman of quality, a Knight,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sir Gervaiſe Ellowayes.</note> 
                     <hi>that ſuffered at the Tower-hill, about the death of Sir Thomas Overburie,</hi> who confeſſed it was juſt with God that hee ſhould undergoe that ignominious death; for oft in Gaming (ſayd he) I have uſed this wiſh, <hi>I pray God I be hanged if it be not ſo.</hi> I wil conclude this point with a neerer inſtance, <hi>A Woman who accidentally came into the Congregation while this word was Preached, did afterwards by writing certifie me, that ſhee being convinced in conſcience of her ſin in wiſhing evill upon her ſelfe, thereby to cover a ſin, which ſhee had committed, but denyed, did feele the ſad effects of it according to her wiſh, begging earneſt prayers that it might be forgive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> her, and that God would be entreated to take off his hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let thoſe wretches heare and feare, and doe no more ſo preſumptuouſly, who feare not to wiſh, <hi>The Devill take them,</hi> and <hi>God damne them,</hi> leſt indeed God let the Devill looſe upon them, and take them at their word. And here it may be obſerved, that ſuch as are moſt guilty, are moſt apt to imprecate vengeance upon themſelves, that they may appeare guiltleſſe. They have no way left to perſwade others, that they are good, or have not done evill, but by wiſhing evill to themſelves. Such is the ſtupidity of a miſled conſcience, that when it is deepeſt in ſin, it dares defie Gods juſtice to gaine an opinion among men, of its owne innocency.</p>
                  <q>O earth, cover not thou my bloood.</q>
                  <p>More particularly Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Great ſins, bloody ſins, eſpecially this ſin of ſhedding innocent blood, ſhall not paſſe undiſcovered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God will give a tongue to the earth, he will make ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creatures ſpeak, rather then blood ſhall be concealed. Blood may be concealed a long time, but blood ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be concealed (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7.) <hi>What haſt thou done? The voyce of thy Brethers blood cryeth to me from the ground:</hi> The blood had no voyce, and the ground was ſilent; blood hath no more voyce of its owne, then water hath, or then a Fiſh that lives in the water hath; theſe did not ſpeake formally: but the Lord ſpeakes thus to ſhew that hee will certainely bring
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48478:183"/> bloody ſins, chiefely the ſin of blood, to light. The juſtice of God in all Ages hath ſent out his Writ of enquirie after bloody men, and for the blood of the innocent (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.12.) <hi>When he maketh inquiſition for blood, he remembreth them, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth not the cry of the poore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But doth not the Lord make inquiſition for all ſin? Or is there any ſin that God doth not enquire after?</p>
                  <p>Surely no, there was never any ſin committed in the World, but the Lord inquired hath after it, ſin ſhal not be loſt, God wil finde it out, and keep it upon record: But when it is ſayd, <hi>God makes inquiſition for blood,</hi> it argues the greatneſſe of that ſin: For <hi>while that act of God which extendeth to every ſin, is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to ſome one particular ſin; it is an argument that God takes ſpeciall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ice of it, or that it is a very provoking ſin:</hi> Though God makes inquiſition for all ſin, yet as if he would let all other ſins paſſe unſought, and un enquired after, it is ſayd onely of this ſin, that he <hi>makes inquiſition</hi> for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we finde not the like expreſſion about any other particular ſin in all the Book of God; though it be a truth, that hee enquires for all ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>O earth, cover not thou my blood.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Innocency feares no diſcovery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come who will, Angels from Heaven, Devils from Hell, Men on Earth, let all creatures be ſummoned into one Jury of grand Inqueſt, an innocent perſon will neyther run nor hide his head for it: He whoſe heart beares witneſſe with him, feares no witneſſe that can be brought againſt him. While conſcience acquits, the matter is not much who accuſeth, or condemnes: He that is righteous knowes that all his ſins are covered by the freegrace of God in the righteouſneſſe of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and he knowes that he hath not covered his ſin as <hi>Adam</hi> by excuſes, nor ſewed the Fig-leaves of carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings together, to hide his nakedneſſe; he knowes alſo that he lives not in any knowne ſin, nor hath wickedly departed from the Lord. Now becauſe in all theſe reſpects he knowes nothing by himſelfe, therefore he cares not who knows him; he cals not for Masks, or Viſors, for Curtaines, or coverings, to obſcure or diſguiſe himſelfe, or his actions under, eyther
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48478:183"/> from the ſight of God or man, but is willing to ſtand forth in the open light. For though the beſt of men may have done ſome act, which is not fit for the open light, yet conſidering the whole frame of their hearts and lives towards God, together with what hath paſt betweene God and their ſoules about that act; they are not afrayd that the worſt act which ever they have done ſhould ſtand forth in the open light; and as for thoſe crimes which men uncharitably charge upon them, every honeſt heart ſpeakes boldly the ſenſe of this firſt part of <hi>Jobs</hi> imprecation, <hi>O earth, cover not thou my blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the ſecond branch of <hi>Jobs</hi> imprecation, <hi>Let my cry have no place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not to have prayer heard and accepted by God, is the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that can befall man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is the laſt refuge of a diſtreſſed ſoule, and the meanes by which we make God our refuge, or flye to him for refuge, is beleeving, and ſervent prayer: Prayer is a duty, and yet it is a priviledge, it is a priviledge, not onely to receive an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of prayer, but to put up our requeſts in prayer; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that askes a ſtop upon his owne prayers, hath at once asked a ſtop upon all his mercies; he cannot looke to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, who tells God he doth not looke to be heard; and when prayer hath no place of acceptance in Heaven, wee can have no place of contentment on the Earth: Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we may conclude:</p>
                  <p>That,</p>
                  <p>Man cannot beſpeake any thing worſe for himſelfe, then not to be heard when he ſpeakes to God. As it is one of the higheſt honours done to God that men make prayers to him, ſo it is one of the deepeſt afflictions of man, for God not to heare his prayers: Such was <hi>Sauls</hi> condition (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.) <hi>God doth not anſwer me, neither by dreames, nor by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim, nor by Prophets:</hi> He could get no anſwer from God, his cry had no place: This troubled him more then the invaſion of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims. <hi>I am ſore diſtreſſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Philiſtims make Warr upon me, and God is departed from me.</hi> When trouble comes, and God goes away, man is in a wofull eſtate. We have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to receive unleſſe we aske, and though we doe aske, wee cannot receive, unleſſe our prayer be received: God receives
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48478:184"/> the prayer of man, before man receives any thing from God in prayer. All our treaſure lies in Heaven, our comfort is in Heaven, our protection is in Heaven; and prayer is the meſſenger which we ſend to Heaven in the name of Chriſt for all things, or, for whatſoever elſe we need on earth. Now if prayer cannot get in, if God will not heare prayer, if hee ſend back our meſſenger without audience, what can wee receive?</p>
                  <p>The ſinfulneſſe of man appeares in nothing, more then in this, That he calleth not upon God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4.) <hi>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? Who eate up my people as they eate bread, and call not upon the Lord:</hi> Now as the ſin of man appeares exceedingly in not calling upon God, ſo the wrath of God appeares exceedingly in not hearing man when he cals (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeeke me early, but they ſhall not finde me. God will powre out wrath upon the Families that call not upon his name (Jer.</hi> 10.25.) but hee powres out moſt wrath upon thoſe Families whom he heares not, when they call upon his name. All our mercies are ſhut out at once, when prayer is ſhut out: nor ſhall that perſon have any place or roome in Gods heart, whoſe <hi>cry hath no place in his eare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Holy <hi>Job</hi> was ſenſible enough of this, nor durſt hee have imprecated, that his cry ſhould have no place, but that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious of no evill) hee was aſſured that his cry had place; and therefore as in the ſincerity of his ſoule he made that imprecation, ſo in the confidence of his ſoule, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to make his <hi>Appeale</hi> to God in the next words.</p>

And <hi>Job</hi> did well, for his purpoſe, to ſay his record was on high; not onely becauſe of the dignity of that which is high, but for the advantage which hee hath, who is on high, or in the higheſt to be a witneſſe. God is ſayd to be a witneſſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or on high, to ſhew how eaſily he can obſerve and take notice of thoſe things which are below: God hath eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely pure and piercing, he beholds all things, and hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them from on high as from a watch-tower, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the object more obvious to the eye: The ſight is ſoone intercepted upon a levell: but, <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 14.2.) <hi>looked downe from Heaven upon the children of men, to ſee

                     <hi>It is lawfull to appeale to God, or to take God to witneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Oath is the calling of God to witneſſe, and whenſoever we appeale to God, or call him to witneſſe, it is an Oath. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tooke an Oath, when he ſayd (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>God is my witneſſe, whom I ſerve with my ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Son, that without ceaſing I make mention of you in my prayers.</hi> Thus in higheſt holineſſe he ſware that he prayed for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſpirituall good, while he was abſent from them, and had never ſo much as ſeene them; and that he paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be preſent with them, and ſee them, that hee might <hi>impart unto them ſome ſpirituall gift:</hi> Becauſe being a meere ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he had not yet made his actions a witneſſe of his love to them, and becauſe no man can be an unerring witneſſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans heart, or of the moving of his affections, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he calls God to witneſſe, who alone knowes the heart, and can tell how much we love eyther himſelfe, or one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>He ſpeakes as much (though in another caſe) to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.) <hi>Moreover I call God for a record upon my ſoule, that to ſpare you, I came not as yet unto Corinth.</hi> As if he had ſayd, By this my earneſt adjuration, I aſſure you, that the reaſon why I have deferred my comming to you, was not from any levity of minde, or change of purpoſe in me, but onely becauſe I was unwilling to uſe ſuch ſeverity as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers among you call for, and would have preſſed mee unto being preſent. We find him in the ſame tenour of ſpeech towards the <hi>Philippians (Chap.</hi> 1.8.) <hi>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Chriſt;</hi> that is, I call God to witneſſe, I love you: And againe (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>Neyther at any time uſed wee flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetouſneſſe, God is witneſſe:</hi> As if he had ſayd, Had I <hi>uſed flattering words,</hi> you might witneſſe it; and that I have not uſed a <hi>cloake of covetouſneſſe, God is witneſſe.</hi> I might have worne a cloak of covetouſneſſe ſo cloſely, that you could not have ſeene it, but God could; he can judge through the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt clouds, and ſee through the thickeſt cloaks and coverings but I appeale to him whether I have put on ſuch a cloake,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48478:186"/> or no. As <hi>Paul</hi> by Oath purged himſelfe from covetouſneſſe of ſpirit; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> proteſted by Oath againſt all covetous practices (<hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22.) <hi>I have lifted up mine hand to the moſt high God, the poſſeſſour of Heaven and Earth, that I will not take any thing that is thine.</hi> This geſture of lifting up the hand when an Oath is taken, is there put for an Oath it ſelfe; by which <hi>Abraham</hi> appealed to God as a witneſſe of his ſincere intentions in taking up thoſe Armes for the reſcue of his <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew Lot,</hi> and that as he had overcome his Enemies, ſo he had overcome covetouſneſſe, which was, of the two, the farr more noble victory.</p>
                  <p>This calling of God to witneſſe, is of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When wee are called by others, who have lawfull power, to teſtifie the truth; ſuch is ſwearing before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When we offer it our ſelves, for the removall of ſuch jealouſies as are caſt upon us, and wee have no other way left, to free, or vindicate our ſelves from.</p>
                  <p>This latter was the occaſion of <hi>Jobs</hi> Oath, as alſo of thoſe alleadged concerning <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Abraham:</hi> but whether it be an Oath of the one ſort, or of the other, both meet in this, that God is appealed to, and called to witneſſe by ſuch as uſe them: and ſeeing he is a jealous God, who will not hold them guiltleſſe that take his name in vaine: I ſhall add ſome cautions for the bounding and directing of our practice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We may call God to witneſſe in weighty matters, and unleſſe the matter be weighty, eyther in it ſelfe, or in the conſequents of it, wee may not; <hi>God is my witneſſe, and God is my Judge,</hi> are not for common, much leſſe for vaine things. There are two things in every Oath or appeale to God which ſhew this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, An Oath is for confirmation (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16.) vaine things are not worthy the mentioning, much leſſe are they worthy the confirming: we ought not to ſtrive at all about them, much leſſe ought we to ſweare about them, which is <hi>an end of all ſtrife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In every Oath or appeale to God, there is an invocation of the Name of God; but the name of God muſt not be taken in vaine, which it cannot but be, when it is taken into our mouthes about a vaine thing.</p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:48478:186"/>
                  <p>Secondly, We may call God to witneſſe when men give a wrong witneſſe of us, or will not give a right witneſſe for us; but if we can have teſtimony upon earth, wee muſt not goe to Heaven for it; God muſt be our laſt reſort. <hi>Job</hi> found none on earth to witneſſe for him, and his afflictions were loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon as ſufficient witneſſes againſt him, and therefore he was neceſſitated to make his addreſſe to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When the matter is not onely ſuch as others will not teſtifie, when they might, but ſuch as no man can teſtifie (none being privy to it, but onely God and our owne ſoules) then wee have a juſt ground of appeale to God; who will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the heart: <hi>Jobs</hi> ſincerity was ſuſpected; and that is ſuch a ſecret as man hath no acceſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and therefore can give no witneſſe to it: Who is ſincere, and who is an hypocrite, is reſolved onely by the teſtimony of God, and of our owne ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We muſt be ſure to call God to witneſſe in truth, <hi>Thou ſhall ſweare the Lord liveth in truth, in righteouſneſſe, and in judgement (Jer.</hi> 4.2.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe we have a witneſſe within us, wee muſt not call God to witneſſe who is above us.</hi> God is ready to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with our conſciences; but woe to thoſe who call God to witneſſe againſt their conſciences. Holy <hi>Paul called God to record upon his ſoule</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.) that is, He did as it were (which is alſo done in every Oath) engage, or pawne his ſoule and ſalvation upon it, that he ſpake the truth: When our ſoules beare record with us, we may venture to call God to record upon our ſoules. But ſome, when they have no witneſſe from their ſoules, yea when their ſoules witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, will yet venture to call God to record upon their ſoules. They will needs be tryed by God, who dare not abide the juſt tryall of men; ſuch would make God (who cannot lye) witneſſe to a lye: They uſe the glorious God as ſome doe, a ſort of miſcreants, called <hi>Knights of the Poſt,</hi> who for a Fee, will not onely ſay, but ſweare what you will. This is higheſt prophanation of the name of God: For as he that beleeves not the truth of God makes him a lyar; ſo alſo doth he that appeales to God for the witneſſe of an untruth.</p>
                  <p>More partiularly, <hi>My witneſſe is in Heaven, my record is on
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48478:187"/> high. Job</hi> ſpeakes this, not onely becauſe he wanted the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, but becauſe of the high eſteeme hee had of the witneſſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The witneſſe of God is the moſt deſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we have not the inward witneſſe of our owne conſcience it is little advantage though we have a thouſand outward witneſſes: conſcience is more then a thouſand witneſſes, but God is more then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand conſciences: Therefore never reſt in any witneſſe, till you have the witneſſe of God. <hi>We labour</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9.) and that word ſignifies not onely an earneſt, or an induſtrious, but an ambitious labour) <hi>that whether preſent or abſent, we may be accepted of him:</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Poſſibly we might gaine acceptation and applauſe among men,</hi> would wee but ſtudy to pleaſe and apply our ſelves to them; but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of men will not ſerve our turne, nor can we ſit downe and reſt our ſelves under their ſhadow. <hi>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy ſight, O Lord,</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> prayer (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.14.) <hi>David</hi> could not beare it, that a word, or a thought of his ſhould miſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with God: It did not ſatisfie him that his actions were vvell vvitneſſed unto by men on earth, unleſſe his very thoughts were witneſſed to by the Lord in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Some, as it is ſayd of thoſe Rulers (<hi>John</hi> 12.42.) <hi>Love the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God:</hi> So long as they have a <hi>record here below,</hi> they little regard his <hi>record who is on high.</hi> There is no greater argument of a carnall minde, then this. He that loves the praiſe, or teſtimony of men as much as he loves the praiſe or teſtimony of God, doth indeed love it more: Seeing there is nothing more unequall then an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall partition of our eſteeme betweene God and Man. Where our obligation unto two is unequall, wee can never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by paying each of them an equall ſumm. We have cauſe to bleſſe God when we have vvitneſſe among men, but the witneſſe of men ſhould be of no price with us in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the witneſſe of God: Not onely may wee have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the vvitneſſe of God, vvhen we cannot obtaine the witneſſe of men; but wee muſt preferr the ſingle witneſſe of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48478:187"/> God before a throng of humane witneſſes; and when wee have enough on earth, yet ſay with <hi>Job, My witnes is in Heaven.</hi> The witneſſe of the men of this world, or of evill men (while wee keepe a good conſcience) is a mercy. But as the witneſſe of good men is more deſireable, than the witneſſe of all other men, and the witneſſe of a good conſcience is more deſireable than the witneſſe of good men: ſo the vvitnes of God is more deſireable than (without which we cannot have it, and with which we ſhal have it) the witneſſe of a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>For as the teſtimonie of God againſt us, is more terrible than that of our owne hearts (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20.) <hi>If our heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things;</hi> and therefore knoweth more evill by us, and every evill more than our owne hearts doe: ſo the teſtimony of God for us is more comfortable, than that of our owne hearts. If our hearts acquit us, God is greater than our hearts, and knowing all things, he knoweth more good by us, and every good more than our owne hearts doe; who can expreſſe or tell how pleaſant it is to receive this teſtimonie from God, that wee pleaſe God. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 133.1.) <hi>how good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a thing it is for Brethren to dwell together in unitie:</hi> But O how good and pleaſant a thing it is for God and man to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in unitie; for man to be alwayes giving witneſſe to God, that he is good and gracious, and for God to be alwayes giving witneſſe to man, that he is upright, and righteous. When conſcience ſpeaks us fair, we have peace and a continual feaſt, but when God ſpeaks us faire, and gives us an <hi>euge</hi> from Heaven, <hi>Well done good and faithfull Servants,</hi> wee have peace which paſſeth all underſtanding, and not only a joyfull feaſt, but a feaſt of joyes, which are unſpeakable, and full of glory. Yea vvhen wee are at the fulleſt Tables of this world, this is the ſauce in our diſh, and the ſugar in our cup: <hi>Goe thy way</hi> (ſaith the Preacher, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.7.) <hi>eate thy bread with joy, and drinke thy wine with a merry heart;</hi> (why? what's the matter now)? <hi>For now God accepteth thy workes. Thou haſt a witneſſe in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A good man dares appeale and put his cauſe to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A wicked man will ſometimes appeale, and put his cauſe to God out of preſumption, and impudence: but a good man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales to God in faith, and holy confidence.</p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:48478:188"/>
                  <p>As it is an act of grace or favour in God to receive an appeal from man: ſo it is an act not only of grace, but of courage in man, to make an appeale to God. It is an <hi>act of grace,</hi> as it is a part of the worſhipp of God, but it is an <hi>act of courage,</hi> or as I may call it, <hi>a daring worke,</hi> as it is a putting our ſelves under the juſtice of God, yea an implicit imprecating of the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, in caſe wee ſpeake untrue: Thus to appeale or ſweare, is a <hi>daring worke,</hi> and ſuch as no man durſt doe (if he knew what he did) but in a good cauſe. It is a fearefull thing thus to fall into the hands of the living God. Some have ventured upon falſe oathes, and appeales to God, only for feare of men. Such ſay commonly, <hi>They had rather truſt God with their ſoules</hi> (by ſwearing falſely) <hi>then man with their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, lives, or libertyes by confeſſing the truth.</hi> Which is not only as if a man ſhould flee from a Lyon, and a Bear ſhould meet, but infinitely more than if a man for feare of the biting of a Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet or of the ſtinging of a Bee, ſhould willingly offer himſelf to the mouth of a Lyon, and to the ſting of a Serpent. To ſweare is not only to ſet our naked breaſts before the Cannons mouth, but with our owne mouthes to give fire to it, if wee utter falſhood.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is the joy and comfort of an upright heart, that there is a God in heaven who knowes his heart, and beares witneſſe of all his wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the terrour of wicked men to thinke that there is a witneſſe in Heaven, and a record on high. Hypocrites may pretend they rejoyce, that God is their vvitneſſe, but its only a joy of the tongue, and from the teeth outwards, or to ſerve their turne: but an upright heart rejoyceth indeed at this, he riſeth every morning, and walks all the day long, and at night lyes downe and reſts upon this thought, <hi>God is my record, God is my witneſſe, he hath ſearched me, and knowne me,, he knoweth my down ſitting and my upriſing, he underſtands my thoughts, a farr off, he compaſſeth my path, and my lying downe, and is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all my wayes.</hi> In the mid'ſt of all the clamours, miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and miſ-judgings of men, it is an aboundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and conſolation to the Saints, that there ſits one in heaven, who as he knowes them fully, ſo he judgeth all men rightly, and will render to every man according to his vvords.</p>

                  <p>God is upon the earth, yea God is in hell, <hi>If I make my Bed in hell thou art there (Pſal.</hi> 139.8.) yet when <hi>Job</hi> acts faith upon God, he ſaith not, I have a witneſſe on earth, but my witneſſe is in heaven (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>He that ſitteth in heaven ſhall laugh, the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion.</hi> God doth not ſit as circumſcribed in heaven, but there the ſcripture deſcribes him ſitting, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwelleſt in the Heavens.</hi> Chriſt teacheth us to pray (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.) <hi>Our Father which art in heaven,</hi> and when he himſelfe prayed, <hi>He lift up his eyes to Heaven, and ſaid Father the houre is come, glorifie thy Sonne, &amp;c. (Joh.</hi> 17.1.) Jeſus Chriſt ſpeakes to God as in that place, and he ſpeaks of heaven as of a place, as of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and diſtinct place, to vvhich he lifted up his eyes, when he prayed to his Father.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>a new Divinity,</hi> which tels us, <hi>that Heaven is every place, and every place is Heaven:</hi> But why did Chriſt aſcend, <hi>why was he carryed up (Luke</hi> 24.51.) when he went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? If Heaven be every where, there's no need of aſcending to get into Heaven, and wee may as properly deſcend into Heaven as aſcend up to Heaven, if Heaven be every where.</p>

                     <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> lying upon his death bed, and having many Freinds about him, diſcourſed ſweetly of Heaven and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: <hi>Bullenger</hi> ſtanding by, alleadged that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20.) <hi>Our converſation is in Heaven:</hi> True ſayd the <hi>ſick man,</hi> it is in Heaven, but not in the Heaven of <hi>Brentius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non in caelo Brentij, quod nuſquam eſt. <hi>Vit. P. Mart.</hi>
                     </note> which is no where. He that makes Heaven every where, makes it no where: Though God be in all places, and whereſoever
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48478:189"/> God is, Heaven is, yet there is more in Heaven, then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all places. That's Heaven properly, where the glory of God ſhines moſt, and where there is the ſpeciall revealings of his honour and power; therefore it is called, <hi>The habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his holineſſe, and of his glory (Iſa.</hi> 63.15.) Heaven is (as we may ſpeake) the place of <hi>Gods glorious reſidence:</hi> This Heaven is not every where, for though God be every where, yet he doth not manifeſt himſelfe equally every where. God hath built Heaven (as that great Monarch, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.3.) ſpake boaſtingly of <hi>Babylon, for the houſe of his Kingdome, and for the honour of his Majeſty.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quaſi a natura inſitam ſuiſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionem Deum in caelo habitate aſſerit <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teles. lib. 1.</hi> de <hi>Anima cap. 3.</hi>
                     </note> A meere Naturaliſt hath told us, That this principle is ſtampt upon the nature of man, that God hath his dwelling place on high, or in Heaven. Heaven is ſo proper to God, that God is often (by a Metonimy) called Heaven in the holy Scriptures. <hi>Thy Kingdome</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 4.26.) <hi>ſhall be ſure unto thee, after that thou ſhalt have knowne, that the heavens doe rule:</hi> that is, When thou ſhalt be humbled and brought to this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement that the God whoſe Throne and dwelling place is in Heaven, ſits alſo upon all earthly Thrones, and is King in all the Kingdomes of Men. Chriſt puts the Queſtion to the Jewes (<hi>Matth.</hi> 21.25.) <hi>The baptiſme of John, Whence was it, from Heaven, or of Men?</hi> that is, Was it from God, or from Men? Was it a humane invention, or a Divine Inſtitution? The prodigall Son cryes out, <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in thy ſight:</hi> that is, Both againſt my earthly, and heavenly Father. Some, becauſe theſe and the like Scriptures call God Heaven; and becauſe it is ſayd after the reſurrection (when all the Saints ſhall be gathered into Heaven) <hi>That God ſhall be all in all;</hi> upon theſe miſtakes, I ſay, they have run into that groſſe errour, <hi>That Heaven is God.</hi> But when the Scripture calls Heaven the habitation of God, the Throne of God, the City of God, the building of God, an houſe not made with hands; it cannot be but a perverting of Scripture and a throwing up of reaſon, to call it God, or to ſay that God and Heaven are the ſame. Nor doth it at all follow, that God is Heaven, becauſe <hi>God ſhall be all in all</hi> to us in Heaven. <hi>Paul</hi> was not teaching the <hi>Corinthians</hi> there what Heaven is, but wherein the happineſſe of the Saints ſhall conſiſt, when they ſhall all be called up to Heaven, after the generall reſurrection
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48478:189"/> from the dead: Then Chriſt ſhall reſigne up his Kingdome (as Mediator) to his Father, then <hi>God ſhall be all in all,</hi> in All: that is, There will be no more need of a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and Man; there will be no more need of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor of making prayers, nor of uſing Seals. All the glaſſes through which we ſaw God, and the outward Ordinances, in which vve enjoyed God in this life ſhall be layd aſide, when vve ſee him face to face: and then God will be King, and Teacher, light and life, glory and happineſſe, to his Saints, immediately, and for ever.</p>
                  <p>'Tis granted, That Heaven is nothing to us without God, yet God is ſomething, yea he is infinitely more then Heaven. <hi>Solomon</hi> beſpeakes God thus in his prayer at the dedication of the Temple (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27.) <hi>Behold the Heaven, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens cannot containe thee; how much leſſe this houſe that I have builded:</hi> If Heaven, even the Heaven of Heavens cannot containe God, then, it is not God. That which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a thing, is not the thing contained, much leſſe is that which cannot containe a thing, the thing which it cannot containe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, that which <hi>Job cals</hi> heaven in one part of the verſe, he cals high in the other, <hi>My witneſſe is in Heaven, my record is on high.</hi> God dwels in the <hi>high and holy place (Iſai.</hi> 57.15.) And Chriſt after he had finiſhed the work of mans redemption is ſaid, <hi>To ſit downe on the right hand of the Majeſty on high. (Heb.</hi> 1.3.) This high place is the higheſt place, all that wee call Heaven is high, but all that wee call Heaven is not alike high. Heaven is a building of three Stories. The aire is called heaven: The fowles of the aire are ſaid to <hi>flye above the earth in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of heaven (Gen.</hi> 1.20.) The Clouds are called Heaven (<hi>Lev.</hi> 2.19.) <hi>I will make your Heaven as Iron, and your Earth as Braſſe:</hi> that is, I will make the clouds which are ſoft like Spunges hard like Iron, they ſhall not yeeld a drop of water, to refreſh the wearyed earth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Storie is the ſtarrie Heaven, where the Sun and Moon move, and where thoſe other glorious lights are ſet like golden ſtuds to adorne, comfort, and direct the World. <hi>His going for this from the end of Heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it (Pſal.</hi> 19.6.)</p>
                  <p>The third is called <hi>The habitation of God, the heaven of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48478:190"/> the third Heaven, the higheſt Heaven.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith of Chriſt, that <hi>He aſcended farr above all Heavens (Epheſ.</hi> 4.10.) And yet he then aſcended into Heaven; the meaning is, Chriſt aſcended above all the viſible heavens, into that, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible to us who are on earth. This Heaven <hi>Job</hi> pointed at while he ſaid, <hi>My record is on high.</hi> Take foure deductions from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If Heaven be higheſt, then there is nothing but ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nety in Heaven: The higheſt places in a civill ſenſe, are full of ſtormes, and ſo are high places in a naturall ſenſe, but the higheſt places in nature are free from clouds, ſtormes, and vapours. Naturaliſts tell us of <hi>Olympus,</hi> a very high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, lifting up its head beyond the middle Region, whither no breath of winde ever comes: you may draw Letters and Figures in the Sand, and come many yeares after, and finde them no more ſtirred, then if they had been written in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and if the higheſt places in nature are alwayes ſerene, how ſerene is the high place of glory? When you are once in Heaven, you are beyond, not onely proper, but figurative ſtormes and winds for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Heaven is high, therefore it is a pure place. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in nature, the more high it is, the more pure it is. Earth is the loweſt, and the groſſeſt of the Elements, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter next to that, is more groſſe then the Ayre; the Ayre is more groſſe then the Fire, which Philoſophers call the higheſt of the Elements; The higher wee goe, the more purity wee finde; and when we are <hi>(in altiſſimis)</hi> at the higheſt, there is nothing but purity, perfect purity; there is not the leaſt mixture of droſſe, nor the leaſt ſpot of dirt in Heaven: Heaven is all pure, and none ſhall come thither but ſuch as are pure. Pure perſons are fit for a pure place and only they art fit: No uncleane thing ſhall enter there, and he that hath this hope (of entring there) purifies himſelfe, not onely as Heaven is pure, but as God is pure, in whoſe ſight Heaven it ſelfe is impure (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15.15.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Heaven is high, <hi>Then Heaven is a ſafe place.</hi> High places are ſecure places; the high places of the earth are ſo accounted; and when God promiſes ſafety to his people, he tels them they ſhall dwell on high, while they are here below. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.16.) <hi>He ſhall dwell on high, his place of defence ſhall
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48478:190"/> be the munition of rocks; and I will cauſe thee to ride upon the high places of the earth (Iſa.</hi> 58.14.) When thoſe builders of the Tower of <hi>Babell</hi> thought to make themſelves ſafe, they ſayd, <hi>Let us build a Towre whoſe top may reach to Heaven:</hi> If there ſhould come another flood, they hoped to be dry, and to get above the danger. Once in Heaven, and we are out of Gun-ſhott; not onely beyond the reach of man, but of Devils too: They who are got into that high place, ſhall neyther feele, nor feare the Deſtroyer any more.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Heaven is a high place, then it is a large and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious place: As a Sphericall, or round Figure, is the moſt capacious, ſo the utmoſt round of that Figure is the moſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious round; in Heaven there is roome enough; though we are crouded here, yet there we ſhall not. We may call Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did the Well, about which there was no conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene his Herdmen, and the Herdmen of <hi>Gerar) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboth, roome (Gen.</hi> 26.22.) In Heaven we ſhall not contend for roome; Chriſt aſſures us that in his Fathers houſe are many manſions (<hi>John</hi> 14.2.) He had ſayd before to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.33.) <hi>Whither I goe yee cannot come:</hi> And when <hi>Peter,</hi> troubled at this ſpeech, put the Queſtion (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 36.) <hi>Lord whither goeſt thou? Jeſus anſwered him, Whither I goe thou canſt not follow me now, but thou ſhalt follow me afterwards.</hi> Chriſt perceived his Diſciples more plunged in their ſpirits with this anſwer and promiſe to <hi>Peter:</hi> and therefore adds a prohibition of their feares, at the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, yee beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me, in my Fathers houſe are many manſions:</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Doe not thinke that I told you, yee cannot follow me now, and that Peter ſhall follow me afterwards, as if the place I goe to, were onely large enough for me and Peter; for beleeve me, there are many man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; I tell you not how many, neyther can they be told, but there are enow, not onely for my ſelfe and Peter, but for you all; yea, for all thoſe, who eyther have, or ſhall beleeve on my Name; if it were not ſo, I would have told you, I would not delude you with vaine hopes, I am well acquainted with all the roomes in my Fathers houſe: and though when I came into the World for your ſakes, there was no roome in the Inn for me to be borne in, but a Stable among Beaſts, yet I will take care that when you come to my Fathers houſe, you ſhall not be ſtraitned for Quarters,</hi> I <hi>who am your Redeemer, will
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48478:191"/> alſo be your Harbinger, I goe to prepare a place for you, and I am certaine my Fathers houſe will hold all his houſhold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tophet is prepared of old, it is deep and large (Iſa.</hi> 30.33.) Hell is large enough for a Priſon; there's roome for all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience to lye bound for ever: But Heaven is large, as a Pallace, or as a Paradiſe; there's roome enough for all the heyres of promiſe, to walke at liberty for ever.</p>

                  <p>There is ſome variety in the tranſlation, but the ſenſe of all meets in one, <hi>My Freinds ſcorne me,</hi> or <hi>Scorners are my Friends:</hi> The word ſignifies to deride, or ſcorne, not in a rude homely way, but to doe it with quaintneſſe of ſpeech, or in refined language, to doe it wittily, and cunningly, cloſe and home.

There is no judging eyther of men or of matters, by what is ſayd of them: In this ſenſe all men are, or may be lyars, carrying a falſ report in their mouths: Should we judge concludingly of men by the opinion of man, how baſe and contemptible would many precious ſoules appeare to us?

He that had judged <hi>Job</hi> by the face, which God had put upon his outward condition, or by that which Satan and his Freinds put upon his wayes and actions muſt have judged him eyther an hypocrite, ſerving God onely to ſerve his owne turne, or elſe prophane, caſting off the ſervice of God. All the <hi>morally illfavoured faces</hi> in the World are of one of theſe two features or complexions; the opinions that went abroad of <hi>Job</hi> made him appeare like both, and yet he was a man moſt beautifull in the eye of God; a man that had received the faireſt Letters commendatory under Gods owne hand, that ever man had to that day, <hi>My Freinds ſcorne me:</hi> What then?</p>

                  <p>The word ſignifieth ſometimes onely to drop,<note place="margin">Tranſlatio eſt a ſtillicidijs.</note> eyther as a Limbeck drops downe the water which is raiſed up by the heat into fumes, or as the Eaves of a houſe drop in a time of raine; ſo, mine eye diſtilleth or droppeth teares. <hi>Job</hi> had a heate within him which might well cauſe thoſe diſtillations, and ſhowres without him, which might well cauſe thoſe droppings,</p>
                  <p>This diſtilling, dropping, or powring out of teares, was the powring out of his ſorrows, and there was more in it then ſilent ſorrow, there was a voice in his ſorrows, or a voice of mourning was mingled with his weeping; yea, this word implyes ſpeaking, in many places of the old Teſtament, where to drop is to Propheſie,<note place="margin">Phraſi Hebrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca <hi>ſtillare</hi> ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe pro loqui ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur.</note> and Prophecying is a vocall act (<hi>Micah</hi> 2.6.) <hi>Propheſie yee not ſay they to them that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;</hi> the word is, <hi>Dropp not:</hi> Both are expreſſed (<hi>Amos</hi> 7.16.) Propheſie not againſt Iſrael, and drop not thy word againſt the houſe of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> So (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.2.) <hi>Drop thy words towards the holy places, and propheſie againſt the Land of Iſrael.</hi> And the reaſon of it is, becauſe words fall into the eare of the hearers as drops of raine upon the dry and thirſty ground, both to ſoften and make fruitfull. <hi>Jobs</hi> teares preacht; the dropping of his eye was a kinde of prophecying: Teares are not words formally, but they are virtually. Weeping is inarticulate ſpeaking: And though God (by reaſon of his infinite, and unchangeable happineſſe) never ſpake that language, yet hee underſtands it fully. <hi>There are</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſpeaking in an unknowne tongue) <hi>it may be, ſo many kinds of voyces in the World, and none of them are without ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14.10.) The voice of teares is very ſignificant, yet God onely knowes the ſpeciall ſignification of it, man knowes onely the generall, that it ſignifies ſorrow. Poſſibly words went with <hi>Jobs</hi> teares; but if not, yet his teares had
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48478:193"/> the force of words: Weeping ſpeakes, though the weeper ſpeake not: <hi>Mine eye powreth out</hi> (or ſpeaketh) <hi>teares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſeven or eight ſorts of teares ſpoken of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and every one ſpeakes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Teares of wordly ſorrow; <hi>Eſau</hi> had enow of them, he found ſtore of teares when he loſt the bleſſing: He for one morſell of meat ſold his birthright, but hee could not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it againe, with floods of ſorrow, <hi>For he found no place of repentance;</hi> that is, hee could not prevayle with his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> to change his minde, <hi>though he ſought it carefully with tears (Heb.</hi> 12.17.) <hi>Eſaus</hi> teares ſpake his hunger after that which he had ſold to buy off hunger, or to pay a debt to nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are the teares of repentance and godly ſorrow; ſuch were thoſe of <hi>Mary (Luke</hi> 7.38.) who wept <hi>and waſhed Chriſts feet with her teares, and wiped them with the haire of her head:</hi> Shee had been a ſinner, ſuch a ſinner as bore away the name from all the ſinners in the City: and ſhee mourned ſo for ſin, that ſhee bare away the name from all the mourners in the City: <hi>Maries</hi> teares ſpake her tender reſpect to Chriſt who ſaveth ſinners, and her abhorrence of her ſelfe for ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are teares of craft and wicked diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (<hi>Jer.</hi> 41.6.) <hi>Iſhmael</hi> goes forth to meet the men that came towards <hi>Jeruſalem, weeping all along as he went:</hi> his were <hi>made</hi> teares, he ſhed teares that he might ſhed blood, and weep himſelfe into an opportunity of doing miſchiefe unſuſpected. <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> teares ſpake treachery, but becauſe thoſe plain-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men could not interpret them, they periſhed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There are teares of love unfeigned and ſtrong affection: Thus <hi>David and Jonathan kiſſed one another, and wept one with another, untill David exceeded</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.41.) When <hi>Jeſus Chriſt wept</hi> at the Sepulcher of <hi>Lazarus, The Jewes ſayd, Behold how he loved him (John</hi> 11.35, 36.) They ſaw his heart at his eyes: Theſe teares ſpake mutuall and reall endeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, There are the teares of holy prayers, and fervent deſires, <hi>Jacob wept and made ſupplication (Hoſ.</hi> 12.4.) He cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prayed: The voyce of his teares was lowder then the voyce of his ſupplication; and his prayers were (in this ſenſe) even drowned in teares: <hi>Jacobs</hi> teares ſpake the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48478:193"/> of his ſpirit, and his faith in prayer: The Angell underſtood them ſo, and he prevayled.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, There are teares of compaſſion for the miſeries of others, <hi>Weep with them that weeP,</hi> is the Apoſtles rule (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15.) When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heard the report of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ruine and of the ſad condition of his Brethren there, <hi>He ſate downe and wept (Nehem.</hi> 1.4.) His teares ſpake pitty to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, and zeale for God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, There are the teares of <hi>paſſion,</hi> in reference to our owne afflictions: Such teares ſpeak humane frailty, or the common infirmity of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, There are the teares of damnation: Hypocrites and their aſſociates in Hell are deſcribed, <hi>Weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth for evermore:</hi> Their teares ſpeak deſpayre, or miſery without hope of remedy.</p>
                  <p>The tears which <hi>Job</hi> powred forth, were of the ſeventh ſort, teares of paſſion, or ſorrow, cauſed by the afflicting hand of God, but eſpecially by the unkindneſſes of his Freinds; <hi>My freinds ſcorne me, but mine eye powreth out teares unto God. Job</hi> knew that as God had a Book for his prayers, ſo a Bottle for his teares; yea he knew teares ſhould be heard as well as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>Teares are powerfull Oratours:</hi> God reads our hearts in thoſe lines which teares draw on our faces. One of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Phyloſophers hath adjudged weeping unworthy a man,<note place="margin">Lachrymae a viris claris au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendae ſunt mulieribus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem relinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae. <hi>Plat. de rep. Dial. 3.</hi>
                     </note> and tells us it is onely for Women and Children to weepe: But as there are teares of effeminate and childiſh puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo there are teares of heroicall and holy importunity. To weep for feare of ſufferings from man, is indeed below man, but to weep to God when we ſuffer, eyther under the hand of God or man, doth well become the beſt of men; not to weep to God, when we eyther ſuffer or have ſinned, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from courage, but from ſullenneſſe, and is not the argument of a noble ſpirit, but of a hard heart. Who ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious as <hi>David?</hi> who feared not a Lyon nor a Beare, who would not be afrayd though an Hoaſt of men encamped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and though he walked in the valley of the ſhadow of death; yet how often do we read him weeping and crying to God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.12.) <hi>Hold not thy peace</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at my teares: David</hi> in that caſe, could not hold his peace from cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and he was perſwaded that God would not hold
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48478:194"/> his peace at his cry; he expected to have his teares anſwered: He did not ſay, Hold not thy peace at my words, or at my prayer, but as importing that his very teares had a voyce and language in them, he deſired that they might be anſwered. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did not weep for feare of men, but in faith to God. And ſo did <hi>Job: Mine eye powreth out teares vnto God:</hi> God was the object of his teares, as much as of his prayers. God is above, and yet our teares fall into his boſome: theſe waters aſcend; this raine doth not fall but riſe; theſe ſhowres doe not come from the Clouds, but they peirce the Clouds. As the heate of the Sun drawes the water upward, ſo doth the heate of Gods love. Some of the Ancients uſe ſtrange Hyperbolies about the power and motion of teares, I will not ſtay upon them, we may ſay too much of them; but thus much we may ſafely ſay, that from a heart rightly affected, and touched with the ſenſe, eyther of ſin, or ſuffering, they have much weight in them, and are preſſing upon God: <hi>Mine eye powreth out teares unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the conexion of this latter part of the Verſe with the former:</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When wee are ſcorned by men, it is good for us to mourne to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Freinds ſcorne me, now, I weep and pray: It is beſt for us to apply our ſelves to God when we live in the embraces of men, when all men ſpeake well of us and applaud us, what is all this, if we have not the good word and the good will of God? unleſſe we have an applauſe in Heaven, it will doe us no good to have the true applauſe, much leſſe the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of men on earth. Suppoſe they ſpeake right, and give us but our due, yet we muſt not reſt in that, but goe to God. The good word of God is better to us infinitely, then the beſt vvord of the beſt men; to him let us have recourſe when we have the greateſt favour, and faireſt Quarter in the World; but when the World ſcornes, and rejects us, then is a ſpeciall ſeaſon for us to haſten into the preſence of God; wee ſhould live neereſt and cloſeſt to God, when men caſt us off, or throw us out of their ſocieties and affections.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold recourſe to God, whereof the firſt is from choice, the ſecond from neceſſity. It is beſt to make our
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48478:194"/> recourſe to God upon choiſe, but he will not refuſe us if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity drive us to him, God is moſt worthy to be our choyce, but he is willing to be our refuge; yet he is indeed a refuge to thoſe onely in evill times, who have made him their choyce in the beſt times. When all goes well with us in the World, we ſhould not thinke our ſelves well till we enjoy God: <hi>It is good for me to draw neere to God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 73.28.) It is good for me to doe it in good times, in the beſt times, this I make my election: And when <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is good,</hi> he meanes, <hi>it is beſt;</hi> that poſitive beares the ſenſe of a Superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: and therefore he had ſayd a little before (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 25.) <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee:</hi> But in an evill time, God is both the choyce and the refuge of his people. He is our refuge proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to whom we come when others caſt us off, and hee is our choyce to whom we come, when others call for us, and ſeeme ambitious to be kinde unto us. It is not thank-worthy to make God barely a refuge, to come to him becauſe wee can goe no where elſe; we ſhould thinke our ſelves no where till we are in his preſence whereſoever we are, and that we have nothing till we have him, whatſoever we have. Not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the leaſt of God before all the World, is not onely un-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous in us, but ſinfull againſt, and diſhonourable unto God. <hi>Job</hi> who here wept to God in his low eſtate, had often rejoyced in God in his beſt eſtate, and preferred him before his cheifeſt joy: They may confidently weep to God in ſad times, who have delighted themſelves with God in comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table times.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Liberty of addreſſe to God, when men ſcorne and reject us, is the great priviledge of the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every man cannot do this; can the men of the world powre out teares to God when they are ſcorned by the world? can they powre out prayers to God, when they are ill intreated by the world? Can they goe into the imbraces of God, when they are caſt out by men? they cannot. They can vexe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they are vexed by others, and perhaps vexe thoſe that vexe them; they can be angrie when they are ſcorned, and perhaps ſcorne their ſcorners, but how to ſpread their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God, or to powre out tears to him they know not:
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48478:195"/> they who can doe thus are honoured by God, when ſcorned by men, and God will powre out comforts into their boſomes who can powre their teares into his, they can never be at any loſſe, who finde out God to weepe to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having thus given the reaſon of his appeale to Heaven, enforceth it farther with a ſtong wiſh, according to our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is alſo confirmed by the concurring vote of divers other tranſlations.</p>

Taking theſe explications of the text, in the forme of a wiſh, The ſcope of it ſeemes, to be the ſame with what he ſpak before,</hi> (Chap. 9. 33.34.35.) <hi>God is not a man as I am, that I ſhould anſwer him, and we ſhould come together in judgement, neither is there any Dayes-man,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48478:195"/> betwixt us,</hi> &amp;c. In which words, as in theſe before us, while <hi>Job</hi> lifts up the Majeſty of God, and humbleth himſelfe, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, to have to doe with God, yet he diſcovers the vehement longings of his ſoule to receive a judgement or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination from God in this ſuit or controverſie, which had depended ſo long between him and his friends.</p>
                  <p>The Obſervations which ariſe from this reading and ſence of the Text, are of the ſame ſtraine, with thoſe formerly given upon that, and ſome other paſſages, where <hi>Job</hi> knowing his own uprightnes and integritie, declares not only willingneſſe, but extreame earneſtneſſe, to have his cauſe tryed at the Bar, and before the Tribunal of God, who both ſaw his wayes, and ſearched his heart: who as he had juſtified him from all guilt in reference to himſelfe, by not imputing ſinne unto him, ſo he would juſtifie him againſt the ſinnes, which men imputed to him, by ſaying he was not at all guilty.</p>

                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:48478:197"/> of the manner how <hi>Job</hi> deſired God to plead the cauſe of man with God, even as man pleades with man; This third makes it a ſecond diſtinct deſire, and the whole verſe to conſiſt of two diſtinct deſires.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That God would judge for a man with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That God would judge the Sonne of man in reſpect of his Neighbour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the former he petitions for mercy with God; in the latter for right againſt man; or in the former he ſues for a judgement of acceptation for himſelfe, and in the latter for a judgement of reproofe, and redargution upon his friends.</p>
                  <p>This difference is grounded upon the different conſtruction of the vvords in the originall. For the word which is rendred to plead or judge, is conſtrued with, or governs (as gramari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſpeake) the <hi>Dative caſe</hi> in the firſt, and the <hi>Accuſative caſe</hi> in the latter clauſe of the verſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence the former is rendred,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That he would judge or plead for a man with God,</hi> which notes favour and a benigne defence or patronage of his cauſe with God, ſo this is uſed by the Prophet (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.4.) <hi>He ſhall reprove</hi> (argue, judge or plead) <hi>with equity for the meeke of the earth;</hi> that is, he ſhall reprove or plead in favour of the meeke, or on their ſide, he ſhall undertake their cauſe, and make their defence for them. And thus at laſt God did judge or plead for <hi>Job,</hi> giving ſentence in his behalfe, and caſting the ſcales on his ſide againſt his friends, and therefore the latter clauſe is rendred, thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That he would judge the Sonne of man in reſpect of his Neighbour;</hi> that is, that he would reprehend and reprove him for the wrongs vvhich he hath don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The meaning of the whole verſe according to this tranſlation, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented and paraleld in that prayer of <hi>David, (Pſal.</hi> 35.1, 2, 3.) <hi>Plead my cauſe O Lord with them that ſtrive with me; fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that fight againſt me, &amp;c. ſay unto my ſoule, I am thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Thus <hi>Job,</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> deſires the Lord to ſpeake a word of comfort to him, and to tell his enemies, or his uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table friends <hi>their owne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall only leave one obſervation upon this expoſition,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When Chriſt comes gratiouſly to aſſert the innocency of his owne
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48478:197"/> people, he will ſeverely rebuke thoſe who have done them wrong. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> had given <hi>Jacob</hi> hard uſage, vvhile he was a Servant in his Houſe, and when he was gone, <hi>Laban</hi> perſued him vvith hard thoughts, but God pleaded for <hi>Jacob,</hi> and rebuked <hi>Laban (Gen.</hi> 31.42.) the Prophet foretels, <hi>That the mountaine of the Lords houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,</hi> that is, he vvill not only deliver, but advance his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Church, <hi>The houſe of the God of Jacob, (Iſai.</hi> 21.2, 3.) and when he doth this, <hi>He ſhall judge among the Nations, and ſhall rebuke many people</hi> (Verſ. 4.) Some have obſerved the ſame difference in theſe latter words of <hi>Iſay,</hi> which hath been noted in the text of <hi>Job,</hi> and render it thus, <hi>He ſhall judge among the Nations,</hi> that is, the Heathen Nations who have vexed his Church, <hi>And he ſhall rebuke or plead</hi> (it is the ſame word in the Grammaticall conſtruction, as here in <hi>Job) For,</hi> (or in the behalfe) <hi>of many people;</hi> that is, for many of his owne people, who have been oppoſed by thoſe Nations; the effect whereof wee have in the next words, <hi>And they ſhall beate their ſwords into plow-ſhares;</hi> that is, God will ſo judge thoſe Nations, that his people ſhall not need to ſtand upon their guard, or learne warr any more; becauſe their enemies ſhall either be turned to them, or be totally overturned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> woe to the Nations, when God ſtands up for his people, he will certainly ruine <hi>Babylon,</hi> when he undertakes the controverſie, and pleades the cauſe of <hi>Zion.</hi> Yea the day haſtens when he will <hi>Convince all that are ungodly, of all the hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him (Jud. verſ.</hi> 15.) that is, againſt his people, for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Beſides theſe three expoſitions of the Text, I finde another which is more litterall, and yet more ſpiritual then any of the three: and it is that which our late learned Annotators have given us, <hi>Mine eye powres out teares unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he will plead for a man with God, and the Sonne of man for his friend,</hi> The mind of which tranſlation is this, <hi>He,</hi> that is, Chriſt Jeſus the Mediatour betweene God and man <hi>will plead for a man,</hi> that is, for me; he ſpeakes in the third perſon for modeſties ſake, though he meanes himſelfe; he will plead for me, (though you plead never ſo much againſt me) for me (I ſay) he will plead <hi>with God,</hi> that is, with God his Father: the Hebrew word here uſed for God, is in the ſingular number, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loah,</hi>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:48478:198"/> not <hi>Elohim,</hi> and ſo it is in the cloſe of the former verſe, <hi>Mine eye powreth out teares, to (Eloah) God, and he will plead with God,</hi> which more then intimates a diſtinct <hi>perſonalitie</hi> or ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence in the divine nature, <hi>One,</hi> who is, and is called God acting towards <hi>another,</hi> who is, and is called God, though God be but one or (uniſſimus) One-moſt in nature. <hi>Job</hi> weepes to God the Son, in aſſurance that he will plead for him with God the Father, <hi>He will plead for a man with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Son of man,</hi> that is, Jeſus Chriſt; whom he called God before, he cals now, <hi>The Sonne of man,</hi> this Title is frequently attributed unto Chriſt in the New-Teſtament (<hi>Matth.</hi> 8.20.) <hi>The Foxes have holes, &amp;c. but the Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head,</hi> ſo (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10.23.11.19.12.8. &amp;c,) Jeſus Chriſt is called <hi>the Sonne of man,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, to ſhew the truth of his <hi>humane nature,</hi> he being lineal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcended from <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtyled, <hi>The Sonne of David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, to ſhew the depth of his abaſement, Chriſt humbled yea emptyed, and nothing'd himſelf, when <hi>Being in the forme of God, he was made in the likeneſſe of men (Phil.</hi> 2.) when being <hi>the Sonne of God,</hi> he ſubmitted to ſo meane a ſtyle, <hi>The Sonne of man. Ezekiel</hi> amongſt all the Prophets is ofteneſt called <hi>Son of man.</hi> The reaſon which ſome aſſigne is very probable, That God ſpake to him under that Title, to keep him humble in the midſt of his many viſions and revelations, for which, end, <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame caſe had <hi>A I horne in the fleſh, the Meſſenger of Satan to buffet him</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.) and though Jeſus Chriſt needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either to make or keepe him humble (he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond the reach of pride) yet he needed much to ſhew and give proofe how humble he was. Nor could there be any greater evidence of it, then this, that he was pleaſed to be <hi>The Sonne of man.</hi> Yet I conceive, <hi>Son of man</hi> may be here only an Hebraiſme denoting <hi>man,</hi> which kinde of ſpeaking is alſo uſuall among the the Greekes. And that <hi>Job</hi> might ſpeake of Chriſt under this notion, is cleare from that faith which he diſcovered in the <hi>myſterie of his incarnation,</hi> that <hi>great myſterie of godlines, God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> of which he ſpake ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ntly (Chap. 19.25, 26, 27.) <hi>I know that my Redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelfe, and mine eyes ſhall behold, &amp;c. Job</hi> believed,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48478:198"/> that he ſhould ſee this Redeemer with <hi>humane eyes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did believe, that his Redeemer ſhould have a humane Nature, or be <hi>The Son of man.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, was <hi>A Son of man,</hi> in reference to his participation with us in all things, which concerne created nature, And he was <hi>The Son of man,</hi> by way of Eminency in reference to his freedome from any partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation with us in corrupted nature, otherwiſe then in the pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall effects of that corruption as the Apoſtle ſtates it (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. chap. 4.15.) <hi>In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, and he was tempted in all points, like as we are, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne.</hi> He that is in all things like man except ſinne, is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>The Sonne of man,</hi> for ſinne is not at all the forme, but all the deformity of man: Hence <hi>Jobs</hi> faith propheſied, <hi>The Sonne of man will plead,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For his friend.</hi> The word in the Hebrew comes from a root which ſignifies to <hi>feed</hi> either our ſelves or others, becauſe friends uſe often to feed together, and ſometimes one friend ſeeds, or provides, and offers food to another. It is taken ſometimes largely for a <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and not ſeldome ſtrictly for a ſpeciall friend (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6.) <hi>if thy friend who is as thine own ſoule entice thee, &amp;c.</hi> that is, if the nereſt and friend that thou haſt in the world entice thee, &amp;c. in this ſtrict ſenſe the word is to be taken here; <hi>Job</hi> was not one of Chriſts friends at large, he was a ſpecial a <hi>Boſome-friend, Job</hi> was not (according to the known uſe of that word among us) <hi>A friend of Chriſt extraordinary,</hi> but he was <hi>Chriſts friend in ordinary,</hi> a man who dayly convers'd with Chriſt, and Chriſt with him; a man who dayly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Offices of dutifull love to Chriſt, and a man to whom Chriſt dayly performed the Offices of bountifull and mercifull love. Hence his holy aſſurance that Chriſt would perform that Office of mercy for him, <hi>The Son of man will plead for his fiend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vvords thus opened are (as I may ſay) <hi>An Epitome of the Goſpel, a little goſpel,</hi> yea I may cal them <hi>the whole Goſpel;</hi> what is the Goſpel but this <hi>good newes, that Chriſt, God-man mediates for his people.</hi> All that Chriſt was is expreſſed in this, what ſo-Chriſt did more then this on earth, is implyed in this, and this is all Chriſt now doth, for us in Heaven, <hi>He ever lives to make interceſſion for us</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul (Heb.</hi> 7.25) which is the ſame in effect, with what holy <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth in this Text, <hi>Hee will plead for a man with God, and the Sonne of man for his Friend.</hi>

                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:48478:199"/>
                  <p>There is one thing further to be noted, for the clearing of this Text: For poſſibly the Reader may ſcruple how the ſame words ſhould be rendred by ſome, as a wiſh, <hi>O that one might plead for a man with God:</hi> and by others as a concluſion, <hi>He will plead with God for a man.</hi> Againe, how the latter branch ſhould be rendred by ſome in the forme of a ſimilitude, <hi>As a man for his neighbour,</hi> and by others as a direct aſſertion, <hi>And the Son of man for his Freind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer to the firſt, That the ſame word may be thus diverſly rendred according to differing Moods of Grammar; and ſo the ſigne of the Optative Moode which is in the forme of a wiſh, is by ſome judged moſt ſutable to the ſcope of this place. So that a wiſh may here be underſtood and ſafely ſupplyed, though it be not expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond ſcruple I anſwer, that the particle <hi>Vau,</hi> in the Hebrew, placed at the beginning of a word, though it be uſually taken as a Conjunction, knitting one ſentence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, yet according to the exigence, and ſcope of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it undergoes diverſe other ſignifications.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, A diſjunctive (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.15.) <hi>Ye ſhall take it out from the Sheep, or from the Goates:</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>And from the Goates;</hi> but becauſe the Law did not command both, but gave a liberty to chuſe eyther of the two; therefore we render not <hi>And,</hi> but <hi>Or,</hi> from the Goates: So (<hi>Judg.</hi> 11.31.) See the Margin of our Bibles; which ſhewes that <hi>Jepthtah</hi> did not binde himſelfe to offer up whatſoever ſhould meet him, in Sacrifice, but one of the two he did binde himſelfe to, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dedicate that to the Lord, or to offer it up for a burnt Offering.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is often uſed <hi>Adverſatively,</hi> and is rendred, <hi>But (Gen.</hi> 42.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Cauſally, and it is rendred <hi>For (Pſal.</hi> 60.11. <hi>Iſa</hi> 64.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly (Beſides diverſe other acceptions of it, which I ſhall omit) it is uſed <hi>Comparatively,</hi> or as a Note of <hi>likeneſſe (Prov.</hi> 25.25.) <hi>As cold water to a thirſty ſoule, ſo is good newes from a farr Countrey:</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>And good newes.</hi> So (<hi>Pro.</hi> 26.7.) and very frequently in that Book. Thus in the Text the particle <hi>(Vau)</hi> is taken by ſome as a note of likeneſſe; comparing the two parts of the Verſe with each other; but
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48478:199"/> by others it is taken onely as a conjunction copulative, knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both parts of the Verſe together: <hi>He will plead for a man with God, and the Son of man for his Freind.</hi>

                     <hi>There is an Advocate between God and Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sin hath made a breach, there needs a Mediator to heale it. God and ſinfull man are (as we ſpeake) <hi>Two,</hi> and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made <hi>One</hi> but by a <hi>Third.</hi> Man was created in a ſtate of amity with God, that ſtate needed no Mediatour; man being reſtored is in a ſtate of reconciliation unto God, that ſtate needs a Mediatour, both to ſettle and continue it: And hee who is the Mediatour betweene <hi>both parties,</hi> is <hi>an Advocate,</hi> a pleader, a Patron for the <hi>one partie.</hi> There was need of a Mediatour, even in regard of God himſelfe, that both his <hi>State</hi> might be preſerved, and his <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſatisfied: But there was need of an Advocate, onely in regard of man, that ſo his wants and miſeries might be declared, and that mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with helpe in the time of need might be obtained. The Apoſtle (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20.) deſcribing the nature of a Mediatour, ſaith, <hi>A Mediatour is not of one,</hi> or (as we ſupply) <hi>not a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of one.</hi> A Mediatour is of two, yea and for two. But an Advocate, though he be betweene two, yet he is but for one, or <hi>of one,</hi> eyther <hi>of one</hi> individually taken, or <hi>of one</hi> ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally taken, eyther of one man, or of one ſort or company of men, who though they are many in number, yet their ſtate, or caſe is one. Thus Chriſt is an Advocate <hi>for one,</hi> or <hi>of one;</hi> all that he is an Advocate for, being in one and the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the maine, though ſome particulars in every mans caſe may vary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Greek word which is rendred <hi>Advocate</hi> in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is applyed to the <hi>holy Ghoſt:</hi> But there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene Chriſt his being a Paraclete, or an Advocate, and the ſpirits being an Advocate (<hi>John</hi> 16.7.) <hi>If I goe not away</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the Comforter</hi> (or the Advocate) <hi>will not come unto you:</hi> that is, <hi>The holy Ghoſt,</hi> will not come unto you. One Advocate goeth away, that the other Advocate may come. Chriſt is an Advocate by way of <hi>impetration,</hi> the ſpirit is Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate by way of <hi>application:</hi> Chriſt is an Advocate vvith God, to get mercy for us; the ſpirit is an Advocate with us,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48478:200"/> to prevaile on our hearts to receive that mercy: Though Chriſt be our Advocate in Heaven, pleading for us with the Father, yet if we had not the ſpirit to plead in our hearts on earth, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ould never receive the good that Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us of his Father. <hi>Chriſt appeares for us in Heaven (Heb.</hi> 9.24.) He appeares as an Atturney in Court for his Client; he is gone to Heaven to appeare for us; the ſpirit comes from Heaven and appeares in us. Chriſt began the worke of his interceſſion here (<hi>John</hi> 17.) Hee is gone into Heaven to continue and perfect it. The ſpirit doth both begin and perfect his interceſſion here; he doth not plead for us, but in us; or the ſpirit makes interceſſion for us by ſtirring us up to prayer, by teaching us how to word and mould, or rather how to ſigh and groane our prayers; Chriſt makes interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us, by preſenting, and tendering thoſe prayers to the Father which the ſpirit helpes us to make, or by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king prayers for us himſelfe to the Father.</p>
                  <p>Some diſpute how, they inquire much after the manner how Chriſt makes interceſſion or performes the office of an Advocate for us; but it is enough for us to know that hee is an Advocate, or that he makes interceſſion for us, though we are not able to deſcribe the manner how: Whether it be,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Onely by preſenting himſelfe to the Father, and his appearing for us, which is an equivalent, if not a formall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion:</p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, By the tendering of his righteouſneſſe, and merits, as ſatisfaction to the Father.</p>
                  <p>Or thirdly, By expreſſing our wants and his deſires for us: Whether by all theſe, or by which of theſe, or whether by ſome other way, is not determinable by us; yet this is cleare that he performes the office of an Advocate for us, and that we receive every good thing from the hand of God, through his hand.</p>
                  <p>Further, Chriſt may be conſidered:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As an Advocate for the whole Church: There are ſome cauſes of common concernement to all the people of God. Thus he was an Advocate for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when under bonds and captivity in <hi>Babylon (Zech.</hi> 1.12.) <hi>Then the Angell of the Lord</hi> (not a created, but the creating Angell, or <hi>the Angel of the Covenant, who is the Son of God) anſwered and ſayd, O
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48478:200"/> Lord of Hoſts, how long, wilt thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem, and on the Cities of Judah againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe three ſcore and ten yeares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as Chriſt pleads for the whole Church, ſo for every particular member of the Church, and that alſo under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold notion.</p>
                  <p>He is Advocate, firſt, to take away our ſins; <hi>If any man ſin</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt is an Advocate for us with the Father in our ſufferings and troubles, to get them taken off from us, or ſanctified to us. Doubtleſſe <hi>Job</hi> made uſe of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually as an Advocate, to take off the guilt of ſin; yet here he makes uſe of Chriſt as an Advocate to get off his ſufferings, eſpecially theſe misjudgings of his Freinds, who deeply cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and aſperſed him, becauſe of his ſufferings; yea a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever makes uſe of Chriſt as an Advocate, to get any good thing, whether little or great, whether for ſoule or for body, as much as he doth for the removing of any evill, whether of ſin or trouble.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Doctrine of a Mediator betweene God and Man was knowne and beleeved in the World, long before Chriſt came into the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many ſaw Chriſt by Faith before he was ſeene in the fleſh: <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeene (Heb.</hi> 1.1.) And as it is the evidence of things, ſo of perſons that are not ſeen. Chriſt tells the Jewes (<hi>John.</hi> 8.56.) <hi>Your Father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day; and he ſaw it and was glad:</hi> And when the Jewes quarrelled at this, <hi>Thou art not yet fifty yeares old, and haſt thou ſeen Abraham? Jeſus ſayd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, before Abraham was, I am.</hi> As <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw his day by Faith, ſo <hi>David in ſpirit called him Lord (Mat.</hi> 22.43.) And as theſe perſons, with all the holy Elders ſaw Chriſt by Faith in the promiſe, ſo the whole Ceremoniall Law was a repreſentation of Chriſt to faith by ſenſe: Every ſlaine Sacrifice ſpake the death of Chriſt, and the ſprinkling of that blood, the ſprinkling of their conſciences and ours for the remiſſion of ſins: Yea, <hi>They did all eate the ſame ſpirituall meat</hi> (that is, the ſame which we now eate) <hi>and did all drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke;</hi> for they dranke of that ſpirituall Rock
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48478:201"/> that followed them (and leaſt we ſhould miſtake what was meant by that Rock, the Apoſtle expounds it himſelfe) <hi>And that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> The Rock did not follow them, but Chriſt who was ſignified by that Rock did follow them. They who are built upon Chriſt the Rock, ſhall never be moved, yet Chriſt is a moving, as well as a living Rock, to thoſe who are built upon him; whither ſoever they move, he follows them. Thus Jeſus Chriſt was meate and drinke to the Jewes as well as to us; for he is <hi>the Lamb ſlaine from the foundation of the World (Revel.</hi> 13.8.) that is, The vertue ot his death ſaved all who have been ſaved from the foundation of the World. As Chriſt was ſlaine from Eternity in the counſell of God; ſo he was ſlaine from the beginning of time in the promiſe of God (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.) which was the publication of his death; he was then alſo ſlaine as to the heart of Beleevers, whoſe Faith (having once a word for it) makes that which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in regard of place, ſpiritually preſent, and that which is not, in regard of time, truely to be.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Mediatour betweene God and man hath beene knowne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in all Ages under a twofold nature, both God and Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have both in this profeſſion of <hi>Jobs</hi> Faith: He beleeved the Mediatour to be God, for he ſaith, <hi>Mine eye powreth teares to God.</hi> There is the divine nature. He beleeved that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour ſhould be man, and therefore adds, <hi>The Son of man for his freind;</hi> there is his humane nature; ſo that not onely the generall Doctrine of the mediatorſhip of Chriſt, but this particular about the conſtitution of his perſon as Mediator, was alſo knowne. Had not our Advocate been man he could not have ſuffered for us, and had hee not been God he could not have ſatisfied for us. Theſe points of Goſpel Catechiſme are ſo neceſſary and fundamentall, that in every Age Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have in ſome meaſure been inſtructed about them. And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>There is one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betweene God and men,</hi> or, <hi>of God and men the man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> He doth not add <hi>man,</hi> to exclude the Divine nature from the Mediatorſhip, but emphatically to demonſtrate that nature, in which he gave himſelfe a ranſome for us, of which he ſpeakes in the next Verſe. For though the ranſome was paid by him who is God, or had a divine nature, yet it was paid
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48478:201"/> in the Manhood, or humane Nature onely. The humane ture was the matter of our ranſome, but from the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gave worth and value to it.</p>
                  <p>Further <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes with much confidence and aſſurance, both of Chriſts willingneſſe to undertake his cauſe, and of the ſucceſſe or good iſſue of his cauſe, if once Chriſt did but undertake it: <hi>He will plead for a man with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Chriſt is very ready to ſpeake for, and plead the cauſe of poore ſinners before God his Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He will doe it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job;</hi> Chriſt is eaſie to be entreated, hee is found of thoſe that ſeek him not, then ſurely hee will be found of thoſe that ſeek him. His promiſe is (<hi>John</hi> 6.37.) <hi>Him that commeth unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out:</hi> As if hee had ſayd, Whatſoever I doe, I will not doe this: And when he ſaith, he will not doe this, his meaning is, that he will doe much more for them, then the not doing of this comes to; hee will readily receive their perſons, and undertake their ſuites, though they have no Fee to give him, nothing to move him, but the need they have of him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt is a powerfull, and an effectuall Mediatour with the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He carries the day; he is a prevailing Mediatour. Chriſt is ſuch a Phyſitian, that no man ever dyed under his hand, and he is ſuch an Advocate, that no mans cauſe ever miſcarryed under his hand. The <hi>Arminians</hi> maintaine a propitiation made, or a Sacrifice offered by Chriſt for all, yet they dare not ſay, it is effectuall for all; but the interceſſion of Chriſt (in their opinion) is effectuall for all. Chriſt dyed (ſay they) for thoſe that hee doth not ſave; but Chriſt prayeth for none but thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. They are not for univerſall Interceſſion, though they are for an univerſall Sacrifice, or propitiation; and their reaſon is, becauſe they cannot deny but many ſhall periſh for ever, which yet they could not, did Chriſt but pray for them. We beleeve that his Sacrifice is as effectuall as his Interceſſion; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed for none but thoſe for whom he prayes, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion being for the drawing out, and bringing home the benefit of his Sacrifice to thoſe, and to all thoſe for whom he offered himſelfe to God. But to the point in hand, The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi>
                     <pb n="394" facs="tcp:48478:202"/> who leaves the death of Chriſt in the hand of mans free will, aſſiſted onely by generall Grace, to make it effectuall to himſelfe, or not, he (I ſay) aſſerts the Interceſſion of Chriſt not onely ſufficient, but effectuall for all, in whoſe behalfe he intercedes: So that we are ſure all ſhall goe well with us in the Court of Heaven, while we have Chriſt our Advocate with the Father.</p>
                  <p>And that we may have fulneſſe of confidence to come to God by Chriſt, let us conſider theſe five things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Chriſt is moſt wiſe to mannage our cauſe; ſo wiſe that he is the <hi>wiſedome of the Father:</hi> If we had an Advocate at the Barr, furniſht with as much wiſedome as the Judge, it were a great ſtep to obtaine in a right ſuite.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt is an eloquent Advocate, a powerfull O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator. <hi>As the Lord hath given him the tongue of the learned, that he ſhould know how to ſpeake a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary (Iſa.</hi> 54.4.) So he hath a learned tongue to ſpeake a word for him that is weary: Chriſt is the <hi>Eſſentiall word,</hi> and the flower of all declarative words is with him; when he ſpake on earth, he ſpake with authority (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.29.) All won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth (<hi>Luke</hi> 4.24.) Yea, his hearers ſomewhere teſtifie, never ſpake man as this man ſpeaketh: And as no man ever ſpake like him to man, ſo no man ever ſpake like him to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is a faithfull Advocate; his interceſſion is a part of his Prieſtly office, wee have a <hi>faithfull high Prieſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, therefore a <hi>faithfull Advocate:</hi> He will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eyther deſert our cauſe, or betray it; he is as ſure to us as our owne ſoules; yea, hee and the ſoules of his are one.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is a mercifull Advocate, hee layes our cauſe to heart, our cauſe is his cauſe: Hee hath eſpouſed the Intereſts of his people, and doth all for us upon his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. When Saints are perſecuted, we may tell him that he is perſecuted, and that hee is afflicted when they are: The Church may plead with Chriſt to plead for the removing of her ſufferings, under the title of his ſufferings, he being the head of the Church, and the Church being his body. Chriſt is, as a faithfull, ſo a mercifull high Preiſt (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17.) and the Apoſtle ſaith, That in all things it behoved him to be like
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48478:202"/> his brethren, that he might be ſo. Chriſt had an ability of <hi>ſufficiency</hi> to be mercifull to us, as God, though hee had never been made like unto us by becomming man, but hee had not that ability (as ſome ſpeake) of Idoneity, or fitneſſe to be mercifull. His being made like unto us, hath given him a double Idoneity, for the tenderneſſe of his heart towards us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In that he himſelfe hath ſuffered being tempted (Heb.</hi> 2.18.) His paſſions in the fleſh were great.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that himſelfe ſuffers ſtill in all our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his compaſſions with our fleſh are great.</p>
                  <p>Now an Advocate, who eyther hath had an experience of trouble in his owne perſon, or is full of the ſenſe of his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents trouble, and feeles his ſmart, will certainely doe his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to releeve him; becauſe in his releife, himſelfe is relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alſo.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Chriſt is the Favorite of the Judge; it is a great advantage to have one pleading for us at the <hi>Barr,</hi> who is in favour with the <hi>Bench:</hi> Chriſt is highly in favour with the Bench: God hath teſtified from Heaven, <hi>This is my wel-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed (Matth.</hi> 3.17.) The Judge is our Advocates Freind and Father.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That we may be further aſſured that he will doe his utmoſt for us. Our Advocate calls us his Freinds: As the Judge is his Freind, before whom he pleads, ſo every Saint is his Freind for whom hee pleads. Some will doe more for freindſhip then for a Fee. We know it is ſo with Jeſus Chriſt, he pleads for his people, becauſe they are his Freinds: This, <hi>Job</hi> makes uſe of here, <hi>Hee will plead for a man with God, and the Son of man for his Freind.</hi> As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd, I know I have a Freind of Chriſt, and Chriſt lookes on me as his freind, and therefore I have higheſt confidence that he will plead my cauſe, and take off this ſcandall. So much for <hi>Jobs</hi> earneſt deſire upon his appeale, that his cauſe might come to a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that Chriſt would undertake the pleading of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father.</p>
                  <p>He gives a reaſon, in the laſt verſe why he was thus preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to have the buſineſſe brought to an iſſue; why he did thus appeale to God as his witneſſe, why he did powre out
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48478:203"/> teares to Chriſt, that he would plead for him? Why all this?</p>

                  </p>
                  <q>I ſhall goe the way whence I ſhall not returne.</q>
                  <p>What way is that (which hath, <hi>Veſtigiv nulla retrorſum</hi>) where all ſteps are forwards, and none backward: this is ſuch a way as wee meet not with in all our earthly travels, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man on earth is travelling towards ſuch a way: travell which way you will, you have as many ſteps backwards as forwards, men comming, and going: but (ſaith <hi>Job) I ſhall goe the way I ſhall not returne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What way is this,? This is the way of all fleſh (<hi>Joſhua</hi> 23.15. 1 <hi>King</hi> 2.2.) This is the way to the grave, that way hath no ſteps backwards.</p>
                  <p>But are there no returne from the grave?</p>
                  <p>It is true, ſome have riſen; there have been ſome firſt fruits of a reſurrection: but they who have come from the grave are ſo few, that their foot-ſteps are worn out by thoſe many &amp; many thouſands of thouſands who have gone to the grave. What multitudes have gone the way to the grave, and are not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48478:203"/> ſome few have returned, but theſe ſo few, that we may ſtill affirme, the way to the grave knowes no returning. That which is very rarely done (the contrary being very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done) is ſaid not to be done at all, or never to be done.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to deny his owne returne; he ſpeakes as if he ſhould not be only lodged for a while, but loſt for ever in the grave; <hi>I ſhall goe the way, whence I ſhall not returne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That <hi>Jobs</hi> faith was clear in the point of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body appeares by the confeſſion which he makes (Chap. 19.25, 26.) and therefore when he ſaith, <hi>I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi> his meaning is (as was ſhewed upon a like paſſage Chap. 10.21.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he ſhould not returne by any power of nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he ſhould not returne to a State of nature; he believed fully that he ſhould returne by the power of God, to an eſtate of glory. Our bodies which are ſowen naturall bodies, ſhall be raiſed ſpirituall bodies. Though that which was ſowed ſhall returne, yet vvhen it returnes it ſhall not be as it was ſowed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, whereas <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſhall not returne,</hi> his meaning is, vvhen I dye, or if I dye, I ſhall no more returne to my houſe and dwelling in the vvorld, I muſt take my leave of all theſe things for ever. <hi>My place ſhall know me no more,</hi> as he ſpeakes to the ſame ſubject (Chap. 7.10.)</p>
                  <p>From the firſt branch of the verſe note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The yeares of mans life are few.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may quickly number them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the yeares of mans life come about quickly, ſo when they are come, vve muſt goe certainely, vvee muſt goe with death. I ſhall goe (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) there is no hindring, no ſtopping of that journey; it will not ſerve any mans turne to ſay, <hi>He hath no mind to goe,</hi> he muſt goe; it will not ſerve any mans turne to ſay <hi>He is not at leiſure to goe,</hi> he muſt go; it will not ſerve any mans turne to ſay, he is not fit to goe, <hi>He is not prepared to goe,</hi> he muſt goe as he is, fit or unfit, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or unprepared, he muſt goe. It will not ſerve any mans turne to ſay, he will give all the treaſure in his houſe, all the money in his purſe, to be ſpared this journey, he muſt goe. It will not ſerve any mans turne to ſay, he will get another to goe for him, or he will ſend one in his rooome. There is no

                     <hi>A Believer can ſpeake of death familiarly.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is good to put death before us under the eaſieſt notions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Job</hi> cals it only a going, a going out of the world, that is all, he elſewhere cals it a ſleepe, and the Spirit of God every where (in reference to Saints) ſpeakes of it in the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable expreſſions. Death it ſelfe is ſo embalmed, yea and cloathed in the holy language, that there is even a ſweetnes and a beauty in it. When a man hath worne a ſuit of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell a great while, and hath even worne it out, or it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes foule and naſty, would he not be glad to put that off, and get a new one upon his back? therefore death is called an uncloathing, a putting off the fleſh; there is no hurt in that; when a man hath tyred himſelf all the day at his work, would he not gladly go to bed? therfore death is called reſt or ſleep. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe or the like conſiderations held forth in Scripture, we may (as it were) burie al hard thoughts of death, as was further ſhewed (Chap. 14.12) eſpecally while we remember that as now life is by many degrees, bits or morſels, ſwallowed up of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48478:204"/> mortality, ſo then death ſhall (at one bit or morſell) <hi>be ſwallowed up of life</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.) For Chriſt hath not onely conquered, but <hi>aboliſhed death, and hath brought,</hi> not onely <hi>life,</hi> but <hi>immortality to light through the Goſpell</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.) Life is good, yet when it may be ſayd of a life it ſhall dye, that puts an evill into life: But if life be good, how good is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, which is a life that cannot dye?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Note, <hi>Job</hi> is very importunate to have a blot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his good name wiped out; his conſcience was cleere, his ſoule was well, he could ſay (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.) <hi>Hee is my Saviour, and I know that I ſhall be juſtified,</hi> yet becauſe he was under aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and harſh cenſures, he haſtens to have theſe taken off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to dye ſhortly.</p>
                  <p>If we ſhould on this ground, be carefull to ſettle our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtates and credits; how much more ſhould we be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full upon this ground to ſee that our ſoules be well ſettled? How ſhould each one ſay, I will haſten to get my ſins pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my perſon juſtified; I will haſten to have all cleer between God and my ſoule; <hi>For when a few yeares are come, I ſhall goe the way whence I ſhall not returne:</hi> And if I doe not ſee theſe things done, while I am here, I ſhall never come back to ſee them done, nor can they be done at all in the place whither I am going There is no repenting, no reforming, no belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the grave: if our ſpirituall change be not before our naturall change, it will never be.

It is not unlawfull, nay, it is a duty to vindicate our credit, and to order the affaires that concerne this life, becauſe we have not long to live: The haſt of death ſhould make us haſt our worke, even the worke of this life; much more upon this ground ſhould we ſee that our hearts be ſetled, that our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall peace be ſetled, how ſhould the haſte of death make us haſte the worke of the life which is to come? But as it ſhould make us haſten that worke, ſo it muſt not make us huddle that worke, or ſlubber it over, or doe it to halves. Such haſte is waſte indeed: For, if we leave our ſoules halfe ſetled, and our peace halfe made; and our repentance and turning to God in the midd way, we ſhall never come againe to finiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, no more then we ſhall, to begin them. Therefore ſet ſpeedily about the worke, and give your ſelves no reſt till
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48478:205"/> the worke be perfected; for when a few dayes are come, <hi>you ſhall goe the way where yee ſhall not returne.</hi>

                  <q>It is an affliction for any man to dye under a blott of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</q>
                  <p>Our credit and good name ſhould be precious to us while we live; eſpecially wee ſhould be carefull to dye with good credit, and not to let a blott lye on us when wee are going out of the World. <hi>Job</hi> would not dye under the name of an Hypocrite, or an Oppreſſour, with which black titles he had been charged by his Freinds. It is a mercy to goe to the Grave with honour among men, and to dye deſired; though it be enough that we goe to our Grave having honour with God, and being deſired of him. A good name is a Box of oyntment powred forth; and a good report (eſpecially among thoſe that are good) is as the embalming of our memories to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And yet the Saints are not ſo ſollicitous for repaires in honour, becauſe of that eſteeme which they have of their owne eſteeme (that's the ſtraine of ambition) and they have learned to goe through good report and evill report, through honour and diſhonour; they know how to goe forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Campe, bearing the reproach of Chriſt: But they are unwilling that Chriſt ſhould beare their reproach, or that his name ſhould be diſhonoured through them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing they deſire while they live, to adorne the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt in all things, they cannot but be carefull before they dye, to remove from their owne names whatſoever might reflect diſhonour upon his. How neer <hi>Job</hi> was (in his owne opinion) to the valley of the ſhadow of death, is yet more evident in the firſt words of the next Chapter: Here he onely tells us, he muſt dye ſhortly, there he tells us, upon the matter, that he was dead already; here he ſaith, <hi>When a few yeares are come, I ſhall goe,</hi> there he ſaith not onely that he had no more <hi>yeares</hi> to come, but no more <hi>dayes: My dayes are extinct,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48478:206"/> that God would doe him right, from the inſufficiency of his Freinds to doe him right: <hi>Thou haſt hid their heart from underſtanding:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Who would ſtand to the judgement of thoſe, who want underſtanding? <hi>Thou haſt hid their heart from underſtanding: therefore ſhalt thou not exalt them; ſo:</hi> To this honour of judging my cauſe, and deciding this controverſie, yea, I finde them ſo unfit to be eyther my Judges, or my Arbitrators, that they are indeed but <hi>Flatterers;</hi> and therefore they may rather expect ſome ſudden judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, or their Children, then that God ſhould doe them this honour to judge for me: <hi>He that ſpeakes flattery to his Freinds, even the eyes of his Children ſhall faile (Verſ.</hi> 5.)</p>

And ſo the ſenſe is made out thus, as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd, <hi>I am extreamely troubled, 'or I am pained, like a Woman in the houre of travell; as ſhee is in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily paine, ſo I am pained in minde; I hvve felt many inward pangs, and throwes, and yet I am not delivered:</hi> But I conceive this expoſition unſuitable to the ſcope of the place, <hi>Job</hi> being about to deſcribe the ſtate of his body, or of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48478:206"/> man, and not the affliction, and trouble of his minde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The word <hi>(Ruach)</hi> ſignifieth the vitall powers or ſpirits, which ſupport man,<note place="margin">Spiritus vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les qui animae inſtrumentum ſunt ad vitae functiones. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                     </note> and ſerve him in all the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of life; ſpirits are the promoters of action, and when the vitall ſpirits are corrupted, man is unable, not onely to act, but to live. The expence of ſpirits, is the moſt chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expence to the life of man, and when a mans ſpirits are much ſpent, he is like a dead man, though he be alive: Wee ſay ordinarily when we are weary, <hi>Our ſpirits are ſpent;</hi> that is, Our vitall ſpirits which give activity and ſtrength to the whole body.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Rather underſtand it literally, and ſtrictly for the <hi>breath,</hi> which comes forth by reſpiration, <hi>My breath is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt:</hi> and then the corrupting here ſpoken of, is not to be taken for any ill ſavour in his breath: they who have corrupt breath are offenſive to others in breathing.<note place="margin">Corruptio non hic denotat ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum graveo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentum, ſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum qui cum ingenti niſu &amp; dolore emittitur <hi>Pined.</hi> Medici Aſthma vocant; &amp; quia Aſthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus ſuffocari videtur, ideo legitur hic; <hi>jam quidem Ago animam.

                     </note> The breath is ſaid to be corrupt, becauſe it ſmels of the corruption of thoſe parts from whence it is drawne; we muſt not underſtand <hi>Job</hi> ſo: But when he ſaith, <hi>My breath is corrupt,</hi> his meaning is, that eyther hee had obſtructions and ſtoppings of breath, which diſtemper Phyſitians call the <hi>Tiſſicke;</hi> a man under that infirmity may be ſayd to have his breath corrupted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he breathes difficultly. And as it is ſo in ſome diſeaſes, ſo it is alway ſo in the approaches of death; a little before a man dyes, his breath ſhortens, he breathes hardly, or he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breathes, he lyes gaſping for life, and catching for breath: Such a ſtate <hi>Job</hi> here intends, The <hi>Tygurine</hi> tranſlation takes that ſenſe, <hi>My life is departing, or I am giving up the ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The breath of man is corruptible, though his ſoule be not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two are very diſtinct: Some make the ſoule and brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h one thing, and argue the corruptibility of the ſoule from ſuch Texts as this. But the breath differs, not onely from the ſoule, but from the life: The ſoule hath a life of its owne, and the life of the body is its union with the ſoule; breathing is the acting of life, proceeding from that union, and ending when that union is diſſolved. Breath may be corrupt, and life may baniſh, but the ſoule continues; the breath is ſo vaniſhing, that the Prophet gives caution (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.22.) <hi>Ceaſe
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48478:207"/> from man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrills.</hi> The breath of man is ſo ready to ceaſe, that it is our wiſedome to ceaſe from man; for when breath goes, man is gone, and all goes with him, in that day his thoughts periſh; and therefore <hi>Job</hi> had no ſooner ſayd, <hi>My breath is corrupt,</hi> but he adds,
<q>My dayes are extinct.</q>

                     <hi>[My dayes]</hi> that is, The time appointed for my life, which is meaſured by dayes, by naturall dayes, or by artificial dayes: Our dayes come and goe continually, and when our tale of dayes is come and gone, our dayes are <hi>[extinct]</hi> The word which here we tranſlate extinct, is found no where elſe in the Hebrew of the Old Teſtament: It is rendered three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thus, <hi>my dayes are cutt off;</hi> which metaphor is often uſed in reference to life; our dayes are (as it were) ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny threads,<note place="margin">Exciſſi ſunt. <hi>Pagn.</hi>
                     </note> and our life is like a peece of clooth woven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by many dayes; when the Webb, be it more or leſſe, longer or ſhorter, is finiſhed, the thred is cut: <hi>My dayes are cut off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Vulgar reads it, <hi>my dayes will be ſhortned;</hi> they ſhall be put in a narrow roome, into a little <hi>compendium,</hi> I ſhall ſoone be able to read over the volume of my dayes,<note place="margin">Breviabuntur dies mei. <hi>Vulg</hi>
                     </note> they are but ſhort, a meer Epitome.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We read, <hi>my dayes are extinct,</hi> or put out. Which is a metaphor taken from fire, from a Torch, or Candle, which is the ſenſe of the <hi>Tygurine</hi> tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My dayes faile, as a Candle, or as a Lamp,</hi> which, when the oyle is conſumed, goes out: Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> keeps to the metaphor of fire,<note place="margin">Deus mei ritu lucernae defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt. <hi>Tygur.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>My dayes are quenched.</hi> There is a flame of life in the body, the naturall heat is preſerved by the naturall moyſture; theſe two, Radicall heat, and Radicall moyſture, worke upon each other; and as long as Radicall moyſture holds out to feed the Radicall heat, life holds out; but when the heat hath once ſucked and drunk up all the moyſture (in ſome acute diſeaſes it drinks all at a draught) as the flame drinkes up the Oyle of the Lampe,<note place="margin">Vita extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quando hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor nativus in quo vita conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit extinguitur.</note> then wee goe out, or as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes here, <hi>Our dayes are extinct.</hi> Exceſſive moyſture puts out the fire, and for want of moyſture it goeth out.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Mans life, as a Fire, or Lampe, conſumes it ſelf continually.</hi>

                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:48478:207"/>
                  <p>There is a ſpeciall diſeaſe called a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> of which many dye; but the truth is, every man who dyes, dyes of a Conſumption; he that dyes of a Surfet, may be ſayd (in this ſenſe) to dye of a Conſumption. The fewell and food of mans life is waſted ſometimes more ſparingly and gradually, but 'tis alwayes conſumed (except in thoſe deaths which are meerely occaſionall, or violent) before man dyes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks peremptorily, <hi>My dayes are extinct.</hi> He was not then dead; but becauſe hee ſaw all things in a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to death, and was himſelfe in a dying poſture; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he concludes, <hi>My dayes are extinct.</hi>

A grave for me:</hi> So the words carry a reciprocation of readineſſe betweene <hi>Job</hi> and the Grave, <hi>The grave gapes for me, and I gape for the grave:</hi> Wee may parallell this kinde of ſpeaking with that in the Booke of <hi>Canticles (Chap.</hi> 2.16.) where the Spouſe ſaith, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his:</hi> The Originall is, <hi>My beloved to me, and I to him:</hi> There are no more words then needs muſt be. The largeneſſe of their affection, bred this conciſeneſſe in language, <hi>My beloved to me, and I to him:</hi> We are to one another, as if we were but one.</p>
                  <p>The expreſſion notes two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Propriety, <hi>My beloved to me,</hi> or, <hi>my beloved is mine;</hi> that is, I have a propriety in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It notes poſſeſſion, <hi>I have him,</hi> I have not onely a right to him, but I enjoy him; I have not onely a title, but a tenure; God hath given me Liverie and Seiſin (as our Law ſpeakes) he hath put me into poſſeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and I have given Jeſus Chriſt full poſſeſſion of me, I am no longer my owne, but his, and at his diſpoſe. So here, <hi>The grave for me, and I for the grave:</hi> The grave is my right; yea, the grave is my poſſeſſion. The grave is a houſe that every one hath right to, and ſome are ſo neere it, that they ſeeme poſſeſſed of it. <hi>The grave is mine,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> or I am as a dead man, ready to be carryed to my grave: The grave is not made ready, till man is undreſſed by death, and ſo made ready for the grave. We ſay of very old men, though in health, and we may ſay of very ſick men, though young, <hi>They have one foot in the grave. Job</hi> ſpeakes as having <hi>both his feet in the grave:</hi> Yea, wee may ſay, that <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes as if he had not onely his feet in the grave, but (which is farr more) <hi>his heart in the grave.</hi> There are many who have their feet in the grave, whoſe hearts are at furtheſt diſtance from it, <hi>Job</hi> had both. <hi>Heman (Pſal.</hi> 88.4, (5.) deſcribes his condition in ſuch a language, <hi>My ſoule is
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48478:208"/> full of troubles, and my life draweth nigh to the grave, I am accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them that goe down into the pit; I am as a man of no ſtrength, free among the dead; like the ſlaine that lye in the grave, whom thou remembreſt no more, and that are cut off from thy ſight:</hi> That Scripture may be a Comment on this, <hi>My breath is corrupt, my dayes are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes in the Plurall number; he ſaith not the grave is ready for me, but, <hi>The graves are ready for me.</hi> Why, how many graves muſt <hi>Job</hi> have? Would not one grave hold him? Or, was <hi>Job</hi> covetous to have many graves? <hi>Many hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will not ſerve ſome men when they live, but one houſe will ſerve any man when he dyeth.</hi> A little roome will hold thoſe dead, for whoſe covetous and ambitious minds the whole World was not room thy enough while they lived. Ordinary men will have here their Winter-houſes, and their Summer houſes their Citty houſes, and their Country houſe, their houſes on the Plaine, and their houſes on the Hill; men have varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of houſes while they live; but one is all when dead: Why then doth <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>The [graves] are ready for me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaith it to ſhew that death abounded to his apprehenſion or that he could not eſcape death: As if he had ſayd, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I ſet my foot, I ſtep upon a grave.<note place="margin">Plurima mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis imago.</note> The Poet deſcribing a tragicall ſtate, ſaith, <hi>There was much of death to be ſeene, or many appearances of death. Job</hi> ſaw deaths, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>held graves every where gaping for him. <hi>Paul</hi> was in deaths often, and <hi>Job</hi> was in many deaths at once: <hi>The graves are ready,</hi> there are many Pits making, I am ſure to fall into one, there's no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding it.</p>
                  <p>Learne from it, Firſt</p>
                  <p>That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In times of ſickneſſe and affliction, diſcourſes of the grave, are the moſt ſeaſonable diſcourſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Death ſhould be much in our thoughts, and much in our ſpeech at all times, but moſt of all in times of ſickneſſe, or of danger. Some when they are ſick, cannot abide to heare a word ſpoken of the grave; others will forbid ſuch as come to viſite the ſick, to ſpeak a word of death.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> was ſo exceſſively afrayd of death, that hee had given command to his Attendants not to give him any warning of the approach of this his laſt Enemy by <hi>Name.</hi> It
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48478:209"/> was worſe then death to him to heare of death; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed, he was told of it, not onely plainely, but rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian reports, that his very Barber, with ſome other inferiour Servants (as if they had rather come as Judges to pronounce the ſentence of death upon him, then as freinds to be his remembrancers of death) told him bluntly and abruptly, without preface or preamble, or the leaſt word of comfort to ſweeten ſuch a bitter potion, That his fatall houre was come, that neither his Hermit nor his Phyſitian, could keep him alive a day longer. They who are unwilling to heare, or ſpeake of death, ſhall heare it ſpoken of whether they will or no. Death ſhould be much upon the tongue, and more in the thoughts of good men when they are in health, but when they are in their <hi>naturall preparation for death</hi> (ſickneſſe is a naturall preparative for death) they ſhould be very often in their <hi>ſpirituall preparations,</hi> by thinking and diſcourſing of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From this manner of ſpeaking, <hi>The grave for mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A godly man is ſometimes as ready for the grave, as the grave can be for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let it come as ſoone as it will, it cannot come too ſoone; as the grave gapes for him, ſo doth he for the grave; as the grave hungers for him, ſo doth he for it, and nothing can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him but a grave. <hi>I deſire</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) to be diſſolved:</hi> He was ready for the grave: And ready he was, not in a vaine wiſh, O, I would dye, and I deſire to dye; but from a groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hope that he ſhould be well in death. <hi>Saul</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.9.) was ſorely wounded, the graves were ready for him, and he was ready for the grave too: But whence was it? It was not from his preparedneſſe to dye, but from his impatience to live; as appeares both by the true Hiſtory of his death, and by the falſe report of it made by the <hi>Amalekite.</hi> The former ſaith (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.4.) <hi>Then ſayd Saul unto his Armour-bearer, Draw thy ſword and thruſt me through therwith, leſt theſe uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed come &amp; thruſt me through &amp; abuſe me: Saul,</hi> upon this account was ſo ready for the grave, that he begg'd to be thruſt into it, and when he could not obtaine that miſerable favour, he
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48478:209"/> thruſt himſelfe into it; ſo the latter part of the Verſe informs us, <hi>But his Armour-bearer would not, for he was ſore afrayd: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saul took a Sword and fell upon it.</hi> The <hi>Amalekite</hi> reports <hi>Saul</hi> thus beſpeaking him (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>Stand I pray thee upon me, and ſlay me; for anguiſh is upon me, becauſe my life is yet whole in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man dyes not by peece-meale, now a little, and then a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, nor is life diviſible, when it departs it departs together, but when <hi>Saul</hi> had no minde to live, it troubled him that he was no neerer death: A diſhonour was fallen upon him, the day was loſt, and he was wounded: <hi>Saul</hi> could eaſier dye then out live this diſgrace. Such a readineſſe to dye many have had, it vexeth them to live, dye they will, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live as they would: this is a readineſſe of deſperation, not of preparation. <hi>Job</hi> was much troubled, paine and ſmart afflicted him, and they had ſome influence upon his deſire of death; but his chiefe motive was above: what old <hi>Simeon</hi> deſired, to depart in peace becauſe his eyes had ſeen his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Job</hi> deſired, becauſe he knew by Faith, that God was his ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes chearefully of the grave:</p>
                  <p>Hence learne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Beleever in the greateſt afflictions of this life, ſees eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing in death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He knowes that he ſhall bury all his ſorrows when himſelfe goes to the grave; yea, that then his ſins, as well as his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions goe to their grave too, and ſhall never riſe againe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes confidently he ſhall dye preſently, the grave was ready for him: But it was not ſo, <hi>Jobs</hi> grave was nor ready, and he outlived this black day many a fayre yeare.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A good man may miſtake the times and ſeaſons of Gods diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He thinks, yea concludes, he ſhall dye, when he ſhall not dye: Wicked worldly men, doe not beleeve they ſhall dye, when they muſt; they cannot be perſwaded that they ſhall dye, when they are ready to dropp into their graves. <hi>Job</hi> ſeemed to have an aſſurance that he ſhould dye, yet he did not, God reprived him from death, and reſtored him from trouble.
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48478:210"/> We are never the neerer the grave, becauſe we prepare for it, ſpeak and meditate on it, or reſolve to goe into it: It is not our holding back from the grave, that wil keep us out of it, nor our willingneſſe to goe to the grave, that will put us into it. It is good to miſtake upon the beſt ſide; God uſually recalls thoſe from death, who are moſt ready at his call to dye.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In that he ſpeaks of Graves in the Plurall number: Learne this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There are many wayes of going out of the World, though there be bilt one way of comming in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whither ſoever we are going, wee are going to the grave, and when we have ſtept over, or ſcrambled out of one grave, wee may quickly ſlip into another, and be locked in faſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Take this from the whole, by way of Correllary; It is our wiſedome to ſtand alwayes ready for death, and the grave, for they ſtand ready for us: Ours is a dying life, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying ſtrength, ours are conſuming dayes, our dayes cannot be many, poſſibly they will be but very few; for ought wee know the grave is now ready for us, and wee are ſure it is a digging and preparing for us: Therefore let us be digging in the Word of life, that we may be ready to meet and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death and the grave, which are ſo ready for us: <hi>The graves are ready for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> proceeds to re-inforce the cauſe of his appeale.</p>

When <hi>Moſes</hi> went out upon the requeſt of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to ſue unto the Lord for the removing of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent plague: <hi>Moſes ſayd, Behold I goe out from thee, and I will intreat the Lord that the ſwarmes of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his Servants, and from his people to morrow; but let not Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh deale deceitfully any more (Exod.</hi> 8.29.) as if he had ſayd, You have mocked me two or three times, and ſaid you would let the people goe, doe not ſo any more, leſt your deceiving of my expectation, prove the greateſt deceit of your owne.</p>
                  <p>The deluding Doctors which ſome delighted in, are expreſt by this word (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.9.) <hi>This is a rebellious people, lying chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, children that will not heare the Law of the Lord:</hi> They did not love the Law of the Lord; What then? <hi>which ſay to the Seers, ſee not, and to the Prophets, propheſie not unto us right things, ſpeake unto us ſmooth things, propheſie deceits.</hi> The wickedneſſe of that people lay in two things; eyther they would have the Prophets ſilent, and not ſpeak at all, or if they did ſpeak, they muſt <hi>Propheſie deceits:</hi> They loved to be cozoned, truth made them ſmart, and they could not abide it. <hi>A guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot endure plaine words, but it loves ſmooth words;</hi> as many as you will of theſe words (ſay they) or elſe not a word; eyther propheſie deceit, or ceaſe prophecying.

In which ſenſe <hi>Job</hi> cals them (which one would

And this is often (and was in this caſe) the end,<note place="margin">Finis operis &amp; finis operantis diſtinguuntur.</note> or tendency of the action, when it is not the end, or intention of the Agent. From this notion of the word,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To be among Deceivers is a great miſery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To be a Deceiver is a great ſin.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>As moſt are ignorantly deceived, ſo there are ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Deceivers: and as ſome thinke what they doe to be very juſt, and that it is their duty to doe it, when indeed it is very ſinfull, ſo there are ſome who thinke what they teach to be very true, and that it is their duty to teach it, when indeed it is very erroneous.

                     </gap>noop't (as we ſay) and heartleſſe. For as there is a provocation (in a good ſenſe) which heightens the ſpirit in well doing, and enlivens it for action: The Apoſtle exhorts to that (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.) <hi>Let us conſider one another to provoke one another to love, and to good works,</hi> that is, let us ſet ſuch copies of holineſſe that others may be ſtirred up, beyond their ordinary pitch, and elevation of ſpirit, to a zealous doing of good. Or ſpeake ſuch winning words, give ſuch preſſing exhortations, that the hearts of your Brethren, may be carryed beyond their uſuall courſe in holineſſe. Thus he tels the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (2. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 9.2.) <hi>That their zeale had provoked many:</hi> But to what had it provoked them? Not to anger and paſſion, towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but to charity, yea and liberality towards the poore. And though the Apoſtle uſeth another word in the Greek, yet he meanes the ſame thing, when hee aſſures us (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11.)
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48478:213"/> that the Jewes <hi>ſtumbled not that they ſhould fall</hi> (but that they might riſe) for ſo it followes, <hi>But rather through their fall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is come to the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealouſie.</hi> The ſalvation of the Gentiles bred emulation in the Jewes, What? Shall they goe away with all the ſalvation? Shall the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles poſſeſſe Heaven alone, whom wee thought the meaneſt people upon the Earth? Come, let us alſo put in at leaſt for a part, and get a ſhare in Goſpel-mercies and priviledges with them. Thus they were provoked to emulation, and this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation was and ſhall be (through the power of God, who is wonderfull in counsell, and excellent in working) a help to faith in Chriſt, and ſo to their riſing from their fall. And the Apoſtle was ſo intent upon the promoting of this deſigne of God, that he profeſſeth (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 13, 14.) that he <hi>magnified his Office</hi> among the Gentiles, not onely to ſave them, but (ſaith he) <hi>If by any meanes I may provoke to emulation them which are my fleſh, and might ſave ſome of them:</hi> He hoped the Jewes would, at laſt, <hi>beleeve for anger,</hi> or for <hi>very ſhame,</hi> and goe to Heaven <hi>in a holy chafe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now (I ſay) as there is a provocation which heates and hightens the minde of man to an eager purſuite of the beſt things; ſo there is a provocation which abates and blunts his edge, which chills and flats his ſpirits to any thing that is good, which was the ground of the Apoſtles dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Provoke not your Children, leſt they be discouraged:</hi> And as the effect of ſuch provocations is to ſome a diſcouragement in doing their duty, ſo the effect of it in others is a thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them onn to doe that which is moſt contrary, not onely to their duty, but to their diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Rayling ſpeeches, uncomely and uncivill language, have provoked many, both to ſpeak, and to doe that which they never dreamt of, or which was moſt remote from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall temper and inclination. For though ſuch diſtempers lye in the bottome of nature, yet unleſſe they had been ſtirred and ſpurred up, thoſe diſtempers would not have appeared and broken out. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man upon the earth, yet when they <hi>provoked his ſpirit, he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips (Pſal.</hi> 106.33.) There are three ill effects of provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Provoking ſpeeches raiſe up hard thoughts of the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48478:213"/> ſpeaker. It is a high worke of grace to thinke well of them, who ſpeak ill of us, or to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Provoking ſpeeches blow up hard words of the ſpeaker; many excuſe it, when they give ill language, <hi>You provoked me:</hi> And though they be not to be excuſed who doe ſo when they are provoked, yet their ſin is the greater, who provoke them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Provoking ſpeeches are ſometimes the cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull practices, and very often of licentious practices. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber admonitions and grave reproofes, reclaime thoſe who goe aſtray, but violent rebukes make them deſperate. Some care not what they doe when they heare others ſay they care not what. Many Children have run ill courſes by over much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and neglect of diſcipline; and ſo have not a few, by the over mvch ſeverity and ſharpneſſe of thoſe that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. Patience is hard put to it, to keep eyther minde or tongue or hand in compaſſe, when wee are provoked: Great provocations are great temptations. When God is provoked he is tempted (<hi>Heb.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the Wilderneſſe, when your Fathers tempted me, &amp;c.</hi> Wee may expound it two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That while they tempted God, by queſtioning his power for them, and preſence with them, they provoked him, he was greatly diſpleaſed with them for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That while they provoked God they tempted him, they tempted him to deſtroy them, or to act that power againſt them which they did not beleeve (after ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences) able enough to deliver or protect them. If then God himſelfe be ſo tempted, that (as he is pleaſed often to expreſſe himſelfe after the manner of men) hee can ſcarce hold his hands, or forbeare to doe that which he had no mind to doe when he is provoked, how much more is weake man tempted to doe that which his corruptions are alwayes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enough (and too too much) to doe, when hee is provoked.</p>
                  <p>Againe, When he ſaith, <hi>Doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Learne, thirdly.</p>
                  <q>Hard words ſtick upon the ſpirit.</q>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:48478:214"/>
                  <p>They hang about the minde, and are not eaſily gotten off. Good words dwell much upon the ſpirit, and ſo doe ill words; when a man hath onee got a word of promiſe from God, about any mercy ſet home upon his heart, the eye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in that conſolation: O it is a ſweet word, the ſoule lyes ſucking at it night and day. And when a man hath once got a word of command from God about any duty ſet home upon his ſpirit, his eye continues in the direction of it. <hi>O how I love thy Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.97.) <hi>It is my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation all the day;</hi> he could not beate his thoughts off from it, when love had faſtned on it. As theſe good words cleave to a gracious ſoule, and dwell with it; ſo it is hard even for a gracious ſoule to diſlodge hard words: O how doth the eye continue in thoſe provocations? And doth not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teach us, that vaine thoughts throwne into the minde by Satan will not eaſily be driven out? How often doth the eye continue in his provocations? The ſpirit of a man hath a ſtrong retentive faculty, it will hold the object cloſe, and as it were live and lodge in it. How many make their abode in provocations, and <hi>reſide upon</hi> bitter words, received from their Brethren? How many lye downe with them at night, and riſe with them in the morning; yea, and walke with their eye upon them all the day long. And here it may be queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>Was not this a ſin in <hi>Job?</hi> That rule of love then was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is now expreſſed (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26.) <hi>Be yee angry and ſin not, let not the Sun goe downe upon your wrath.</hi> Then, how could <hi>Job</hi> ſuffer his <hi>eye to continue in theſe provocations?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, There was an infirmity in this; 'tis our duty, as to forgive, ſo to forget, or lay aſide the thought of injuries and wrongs received: And it is the Character of wicked men, <hi>They ſleep not unleſſe they have done miſchiefe (Pro.</hi> 4.16.) Their eye continues in their owne corruption, or in the temptation of Satan till they have brough it forth. For as when good men have ſtrong impreſſions unto good upon their ſpirits, they cannot ſleep till they have done good: their eye continues in that holy provocation (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.4.) <hi>I will not</hi> (ſaith zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>David) give ſleep to my eyes, nor ſlumber to my eye lids, untill I finde out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob:</hi> So wicked men give no ſleep to their eyes till they
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48478:214"/> have done that miſcheife, or executed that revenge to which they conceive themſelves provoked. But the eye of <hi>Job</hi> did not continue in thoſe unfreindly provocations, to watch an opportunity for ſelfe-revenge upon, or of doing miſcheife to his Freinds: He did not let the Sun goe downe upon wrath, that he might deviſe their ruine in the darke. He was not ſo wiſe as he ſhould have been to hurt himſelfe, and hinder his reſt, by ſuch a continuall poring upon their unkindneſſes; but he was not wicked at all, much leſſe ſo wicked (which ſome from this paſſage may conceive him) as to pore upon their unkindneſſes, with a purpoſe to hurt them:. So, that act might have ſomewhat of ſin in it, becauſe hee troubled his owne peace more then he needed, but it had not this ſin in it, that he ſtudyed how to trouble the peace of others.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We may rather interpret theſe words to the blame of his Freinds, who continued to provoke him, then to his, whoſe eye (becauſe they did ſo) could ſee nothing but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or at leaſt muſt ſee that, whatſoever it ſaw, and therefore could not but continue in it. How could the eye of <hi>Hannah</hi> chuſe but continue in the provocation of <hi>Peninnah,</hi> when it is ſayd (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.6, 7.) That as her Husband <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kanah</hi> gave her ſpeciall tokens of his love, yeare by yeare, ſo ſhee provoked her to make her fret yeare by yeare, therefore ſhee wept and did not eate. <hi>While a provocation is continued, our ſenſe of it can hardly be intermitted.</hi>

                     <hi>To ſtrike hands,</hi> is a phraſe of ſpeech grounded upon that ancient forme of making bargaines or entring contracts, by joyning, or ſtriking hands: And theſe contracts may be taken two wayes, or under a double notion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As they concerned ſuretiſhip for Money, in which ſenſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of it more then once (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.1.) <hi>My Son if thou be ſurety for thy Freind: If thou have ſtriken hands with a ſtranger;</hi> that is, if thou haſt entred into Bond for him, and haſt teſtified it by ſtriking hands, then, <hi>&amp;c. (Prov.</hi> 22.26.<note place="margin">Haec eſt ſponſio quae propriè ad mammorum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotium ſpectat. <hi>Aben Ezra. in Prov. 6.</hi>
                     </note>) <hi>Be not thou one of them that ſtrike hands;</hi> that is, Be not too forward to engage thy ſelfe, or to undertake for others; as it is expounded in the next words, <hi>or of them that are ſureties for debts;</hi> ſuch haſty engagements may bring thee into more trouble, then thou wilt be able to get off in haſte: There are many who have ſtruck, yea wounded their owne hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably, by ſtriking hands for their Freinds. Goe to the Courts of Juſtice, and there is nothing more frequently heard of, then the ſighes of Sureties: He diſaſſures his owne Eſtate, who aſſures for others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As Contracts and Suretiſhip for Money were confirmed by ſtriking hands; ſo it is very probable that thoſe ſuretiſhips which were given about Tryals, and for appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Action of the Plaintiffe in Judgement, were alſo confirmed by that outward ceremony; in which ſenſe we are to underſtand it here.</p>
                  <p>Further, The word which we tranſlate to <hi>Strike,</hi> ſignifies alſo to Faſten, which ſhewes another part of the ceremony; for as ſtriking, ſo joyning and claſping of hands was uſed.</p>
                  <p>Once more, the word ſignifies,<note place="margin">Clangere tuba. Comploſis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ſonus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur.</note> and oft is applyed to the ſounding of a Trumpet, or the giving of any ſound: This alſo carries on the ſame alluſion, becauſe when two men ſtrike hands, they make a ſound, the interpretation of which is, that the bargaine is made, or it ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the whole Text is carryed on in termes alluding to the ordinary proceeding, eyther in becomming Bound with another for Money, or in giving aſſurance to performe, and ſtand to the arbitrement, or award of thoſe who ſhall judge, and determine any matter in difference: But how are wee to apply this to the preſent caſe?</p>
                  <q>Lay downe now, put me in a ſurety with thee, who is hee that will ſtrike hands with me?</q>
                  <p>There are three or foure expoſitions given about it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That <hi>Job,</hi> in theſe words, deſires God to give ſurety that he would ſtand to the judgement which ſhould be given: or he would have God aſſure him,<note place="margin">Da fidejuſſorem apud te, qui in hac contentione quae mihi tecum intercidit ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat te ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum iis quae ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicata fuerint; ut te non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam judicem geras ſed tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam litigato rem. <hi>Merc.</hi> Familiarius quam par erat cum Deo agit. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> that hee would not deale with him according to the ſeverity of his Juſtice, or the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Soveraignty as a Judge, but deſcend to ſuch a courſe as is uſuall among men, while they are engaged in any controverſie between themſelves. <hi>Job</hi> hath ſpoken the ſame ſenſe cleerely before, in ſome other paſſages of this Book, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9 33, 34.) But this ſenſe is not cleere to the ſcope of the preſent place: And therefore as they who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, confeſſe, that <hi>Job</hi> was ſomewhat too bold with God, ſo wee may ſay that they are ſomewhat too bold with the Text.</p>
                  <p>For the reaſon or ground upon which <hi>Job</hi> deſires that God would give him a ſurety, hath no correſpondence with this interpretation (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 4.) <hi>For thou haſt hid their heart from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> Now, what coherence is there betweene theſe two, that <hi>Job</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Thou haſt hid their heart</hi> (that is, the heart of theſe men) <hi>from underſtanding: therefore give mee a ſurety that thou wilt proceed with me after the manner of men.</hi> Beſides the words of the fifth Verſe oppoſe it yet more. <hi>He that ſpeaks flattery to his Freind, the eyes of his Children ſhall faile.</hi> Now, for <hi>Job</hi> to deſire God to put him in a ſurety that hee would deale thus, or thus with him, becauſe the man who ſpeakes flattery to his Freind, his Childrens eyes ſhall faile, hath no argument at all in it; yet the abetters of this Interpretation mollifie all, by ſaying, that <hi>Job</hi> ſpake from a diſturbed ſpirit, being much moved with the ill dealing of his Freinds, and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48478:216"/> though there may be ſome inconſiſtence with the context, yet the Text conſidered in its owne compaſſe, beares it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but I paſſe from it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That <hi>Job</hi> deſires God to appoint a Surety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and his Freinds, who ſhould undertake both Gods cauſe and his againſt them three: As if hee had ſayd, <hi>Lord, my Freinds have wronged me, and they have wronged thee too, O that thou wouldeſt provide a man furniſhed with wiſedome, and a ſpirit of diſcerning, both to right thy honour, and to cleare up my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Elihu,</hi> who appeared ſhortly after, upon the Stage, and there acted ſuch a part as this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly (ſay others) <hi>Job</hi> deſires that God himſelfe would be his Surety, and take up the whole matter betweene him and his Freinds; which hee alſo did in the latter end of this Book, giving judgement for <hi>Job,</hi> and blaming the miſcarriage of his Freinds. So the word is uſed (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.14.) when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> lay ſick, even unto death, he prayed, <hi>Lord I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, undertake for me,</hi> It is this word, <hi>Be Surety for me.</hi> A learned Tranſlator renders it, <hi>Weave me through,</hi> or <hi>weave me to the end;</hi> for the word ſignifies the Thred in weaving,<note place="margin">Pertexe me. <hi>Jun.</hi>
                     </note> called the <hi>Woofe,</hi> which being put upon the Shuttle, is caſt through the <hi>Warpe,</hi> in making Cloath, whether Linnen or Woollen; thus it is uſed (<hi>Lev.</hi> 13.52.) and ſo theſe words of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> carry on the Allegory of the tenth Verſe, <hi>I ſayd in the cutting off of my dayes, &amp;c.</hi> and of the twelfth Verſe, <hi>I have cut off like a Weaver my life, he will cut me off with pining ſickneſſe.</hi> In both which Verſes, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> compares mans life to a peece of Cloath in the Loome, which is made ſometimes ſhorter, and ſometimes longer, and whereſoever it ends, the Woofe, or running Thred is cut off: Hence <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayeth, Lord, theſe ſickneſſes, like a ſharpe Knife, threaten to cut the thred of my life, yet I beſeech thee, doe thou weave on, weave me to the end of that Warpe which is given to man, in the common courſe of nature, and let not this ſickneſſe cut my thred in the mid-way: This is a good ſenſe of the Text.</p>
                  <p>But when our Tranſlators render the word, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertake for me;</hi> the meaning is, I am ſore oppreſſed with the violence of this ſickneſſe, which like one of the Sergeants of cruell death hath arreſted me, nor is there any way for me to eſcape, unleſſe thou, O Lord, reſcue me out of its hands, or (as it
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48478:217"/> were) give Bayle, and become ſurety for me, <hi>I am oppreſt, O Lord, undertake for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> having done a great peece of Juſtice which contracted him much envy, and had drawne many Enemies upon him, thus beſpeakes God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.121, 122.) <hi>I have done judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice, leave me not to mine oppreſſors, be ſurety for thy Servant:</hi> that is, mainetaine mee againſt thoſe who vvould wrong me becauſe I have done right; put thy ſelfe, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe betweene mee and mine Enemies, as if thou wert my pledge. Impartiall juſtice upon oppreſſors, layes the Judges open to oppreſſion; but they who run greateſt hazzards, in zeale for God, ſhall finde God ready to be their Surety, when they pray, <hi>Be ſurety for thy ſervants.</hi> And thus we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Job</hi> entreating the Lord to be his <hi>Surety,</hi> and Protector againſt all thoſe oppoſitions, and miſapprehenſions which were heaped upon him by man. <hi>David</hi> was aſſured that God would be his Surety (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.5.) <hi>In the time of trouble hee ſhall hide me in his pavilion;</hi> and he aſſures all that feare God, that he will be their Surety (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.20.) <hi>Thou ſhalt hide them in the ſecret of thy preſence, from the pride of man: Thou ſhalt keep them ſecretly in a Pavilion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pone me juxta te &amp; cujuſvis manus pugnet contra me. <hi>Vulg.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>from the ſtrife of tongues.</hi> To this ſenſe the Vulgar Latine tranſlates the whole Verſe, <hi>Put me neere thy ſelfe, and then let whoſe will contend with me;</hi> that is, Doe thou ſtand by me, and undertake for me, and then I feare not who oppoſeth me: Which anſwers that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.) <hi>If God be with us, who can be againſt us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This expoſition holds out a comfortable truth to us, yet the Text ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emes to ayme at ſomewhat elſe; for the words are not barely, <hi>Put me in a ſurety,</hi> but, <hi>Put me in a ſurety with thee;</hi> which ſhewes that God and the Surety he deſired, were two, or diſtinct; his prayer was not that God would be his Surety, but that hee might have a Surety with God. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The whole Verſe is thus read word for word out of the Originall; <hi>Appoint I pray thee, my Surety with thee, who is he then that will ſtrike upon my hand;</hi> that is, Appoint Chriſt, who is with thee in Heaven (and hath already agreed with thee, to be the Surety of diſtreſſed ſinners, appoint him I ſay) to plead my cauſe, and to ſtand up for me, and then no man will dare to contend with me. So the words are of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48478:217"/> the ſame meaning with (<hi>Chap.</hi> 16.21.) where <hi>Job</hi> having made his appeale to God, declares his confidence that Chriſt would plead for him, and appeare his Advocate.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>FIrſt, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is not onely an Advocate for his people, but their Surety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee doth not onely plead our cauſe, but pay our debts. Chriſt entered into Bond for us, and took all our debts and duties, whatſoever we owe to God, upon himſelfe, to ſee all performed, that we might goe free, and be accepted (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22.) <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made the ſurety of a better Teſtament.</hi> Where the ſame word which is here uſed by <hi>Job,</hi> is (with the difference onely of that Dialect) uſed alſo in the Syriake ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Epiſtle. Jeſus Chriſt may be called the <hi>Surety of the Covenant</hi> two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he ratifies it on Gods part, making Faith of it unto us, or aſſuring us that all the mercies and good things therein granted and promiſed, ſhall be made good, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled to every Beleever; as the Apoſtle concludes (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>For all the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him Amen:</hi> that is, He will give a being and an accompliſhment to them all. Whatſoever God hath ſpoken, he will ſee it done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt is called the ſurety of the Covenant becauſe he ratifies it on our part: For though (as <hi>Socinians</hi> object againſt this point) we ſent not Chriſt unto God in our name, but God ſent him to us in his name, yet Chriſt did undertake, as in our nature, ſo in our Name, and did reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate with God on our behalfe, that whatſoever was owing to his juſtice and holineſſe by man, eyther as a penalty for paſt defaults, or as a duty to preſent commands, ſhould all be ſatiſfied and performed by himſelfe: And as Chriſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Surety) did both theſe in his owne perſon, by active and paſſive obedience, ſo farr as it was <hi>ſatisfactory;</hi> ſo (as a Surety) he helpes us to performe the latter ſo farr as it is <hi>gratulatory.</hi> For whatſoever duty God requires of us, and cals us to, in teſtimony of our thankfulneſſe for his benefits, and of our ſubmiſſion to his will, this Chriſt undertakes to his Father that we ſhall doe, and accordingly out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe gives us grace and ſtrength to doe it.</p>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:48478:218"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If Chriſt be ſurety for us, we need not feare any oppoſer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Put me in a ſurety with thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) who will ſtrike hands with me:</hi> who will contend with me, or ſue me? When ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Money or duty which a man is bound to pay, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready payd by his Surety, or is undertaken for by a Surety, who is not onely able but willing to pay, what needs he to feare? The Creditor cannot Arreſt the Debtor, if the Surety have diſcharged and cancel'd the Bond. Thus the Apoſtle teaches Faith to tryumph (<hi>Rom</hi> 8.33, 34.) <hi>Who ſhall lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth; it is Chriſt who dyed, yea rather who is riſen againe? Jobs</hi> challenge, <hi>Who is he that will ſtrike hands with me?</hi> is very parallell in words, and full to the ſenſe of <hi>Pauls, Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Surety is of Gods appointing, not of our owne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Appoint, I pray</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) put me in a ſurety with thee.</hi> We ſinned of our ſelves, but we could not finde a Surety of our ſelves. <hi>God ſent his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thoſe that were under the Law (Gal.</hi> 4 4.) God ſent his Son, man did not ſend for him, no nor ſue for him: The way of our deliverance was as much from the will and wiſedome of God as from his mercy (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10.) <hi>By the which will wee are ſanctified through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> It was as impoſſible for man to contrive this way of his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as it was to deliver himſelfe. <hi>Job</hi> did not direct God to this way of acquitting by a Surety, but God having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it to <hi>Job,</hi> he prayes for the effect and comfort of it, to his owne ſoule: when a Beleever burdened with ſin, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed by temptation, ſpreads his condition, and makes his moane to God, he in effect beggs of him (as <hi>Job</hi> here did) to appoint and put him in a ſurety with him, by perſwading his heart, that Jeſus Chriſt became bound for him, and hath diſcharged all his engagements according to that eternall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and Ordination of ſaving lapſed man by his mediation. To which Ordination Jeſus Chriſt moſt willingly conſented, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9.) <hi>Then ſayd I, Loe, I come to doe thy will, O God, &amp;c.</hi> Which readineſſe and freeneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt to undertake for us, is alſo elegantly deſcribed
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:48478:218"/> by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah (Chap.</hi> 30.21.) by that very word which <hi>Job</hi> uſeth in this place, <hi>For who is this, that engageth his heart to approach unto me, ſaith the Lord?</hi> The Jewes had beene long under the <hi>Babylonian</hi> yoak, and their Governours were eyther ſtrangers, or appointed by ſtrangers. But the Lord promiſed in this Verſe, that <hi>their Nobles ſhould be of themſelves, and that their Governour ſhould proceed from the midſt of them:</hi> Which was verified, when God turned their Captivity as Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the South, and rayſed up <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and others of the Jewiſh line, to reaſſume the Government of <hi>Judah.</hi> But this Propheſie was chiefely intended and verified in a ſpirituall ſenſe, when God ſent Jeſus Chriſt, A Governour, proceeding from the midſt of them (of whom <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> was but a type) for of him the Lord ſpeakes chiefely in this admiring Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Who is this, that engageth his heart to approach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nto me?</hi> Or who is this that with his heart (that is, with ſo much chearefulneſſe and willingneſſe) hath put himſelfe as a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for this people with me, to approach to me in their cauſe, and to take upon him the diſpatch of all their affaires, and concernments with me, in the Court of Heaven? <hi>Who is this great, this forward Engager,</hi> but <hi>he who alſo ſayd, Loe, I come to doe thy will, O God?</hi> What will came he to doe? Even this, To be a Surety, and ſo a Sacrifice to God for ſinners (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.) Thus the whole buſineſſe of our deliverance, and the firſt motions to it, lay quite without us. God appointed and put in Chriſt our ſurety with him, and Chriſt freely condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to be our ſurety, knowing that the whole debt muſt lye upon his diſcharge: <hi>Put me in a ſurety with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it may be doubted, how this notion of a Surety, ſuites with this place, ſeeing <hi>Jobs</hi> controverſie was with man, not with God; and himſelfe alſo had profeſſed that all was cleare for him in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That although men accuſed <hi>Job,</hi> yet their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation reacht his peace with God, for had he been ſuch a one as they repreſented him, he muſt needs have fallen under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpleaſure, more then he did under theirs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while he pleaded <hi>Not-guilty</hi> to their charge, he beggs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcoveries of the favour of God to him through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, by the remembrance of whoſe <hi>Suretiſhip</hi> his heart was confirmed in the pardon of all his ſinfull faylings againſt
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48478:219"/> God, vvhereof he was guilty, as well as his heart told him that hee was not guilty of thoſe wilfull ſins wherewith hee was accuſed by men. When we lye under wrongfull accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, of which we indeed need no ſurety to acquit us, it is good to view and renew our Intereſt in <hi>the Surety,</hi> who will acquit us where there is need.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> proceeeds to re-inforce the reaſon why he deſired God to undertake, or to provide a Surety for him.</p>

But when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt hid their heart from underſtanding,</hi> we are to reſtraine it to the matter in hand, or to his particular caſe: As if he had ſayd, <hi>Thou haſt hid the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what thou haſt done to me from their hearts; thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences are myſteries and riddles which they cannot unfold; and as
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48478:219"/> they know not the meaning of what thou doſt, ſo they know not my meaning, when I ſayd (Chap.</hi> 9.17.) <hi>He hath multiplyed my wounds without cauſe,</hi> Nor vvhen I ſayd (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 22.) <hi>He deſtroyeth the perfect and the wicked. Theſe ſayings are ſecrets to my Freinds: Now, Lord, for as much as theſe men have no true inſight in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent controverſie, therefore I begg that thou wouldeſt undertake for me, or put me in a ſurety with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, For the clearing of this Scripture, it may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned: Firſt, how God is ſayd to hide the heart from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? God doth this foure wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By ſpeaking darkely, or in ſuch a manner, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding cannot eaſily finde a paſſage to the things that are ſpoken. <hi>A Parable is a darke ſaying:</hi> And when Chriſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parables, <hi>His Diſciples came and ſayd unto him, Why ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou to them in Parables (Matth.</hi> 13.10.) Now among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons which Chriſt was pleaſed to give of that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, this was one (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 14.) <hi>In them is fulfilled the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of Iſaiah, which ſaith, By hearing yee ſhall heare, and ſhall not underſtand: and ſeeing yee ſhall ſee and ſhall not perceive.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſayd, Theſe men have juſtly deſerved to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſpirituall darkneſſe (which is <hi>not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi>) and therefore I have ſpoken to them in a darke way. They did not heare to obey vvhat was plaine and eaſie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and therefore now they ſhall heare, what they cannot underſtand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God hides the heart from underſtanding, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, or not giving light; and that a twofold light.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The outward light of his word: Thus all thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſayd to <hi>ſit in darkneſſe;</hi> that is, To have no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the things of God, where the Gospell is not publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By denying, or not giving the inward light of his ſpirit, though the light of the World abound. For as a man may have the Sun ſhining in his face, and yet be in the darke, if he wants eyeſight: So (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4.) the Goſpell is hid in the moſt glorious ſhining of it to thoſe, whoſe <hi>mindes the God of this World hath blinded.</hi> Now, every man is borne ſpiritually blinde, or he is blinde by nature, and he is blinded by the God of <hi>this Worlds,</hi> till the God of <hi>all Worlds</hi> ſends his ſpirit with the Word for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of his eyes.</p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:48478:220"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, God hides the heart from underſtanding, as by not giving, ſo by vvithdrawing the light vvhich he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Many have forfeited their eye-ſight and their light, and God hath taken the forfeiture of them: Which he doth firſt, when men are proud of the light, and puft up with knowledg. Secondly, vvhen men are unthankfull for the light, and vvill not acknowledge God the giver of it. Thirdly, vvhen men grow vvanton or vaine in the light, vvhen they abuſe it, and having the light vvalke in darkneſſe. All vvhich reaſons of Gods vvithdrawing light, as many Scriptures teſtifie, ſo they are all teſtified in that one Scripture (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 22.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As God may be ſayd to hide the heart from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, by a totall withdrawing of light, ſo by vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it for a time, or in part, by clouding or eclipſing it. God hides the heart of ſome men from underſtanding, onely in ſuch a point, or at ſuch a ſeaſon, giving them light in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, yea and in that thing too at another ſeaſon. This fourth way I conceive moſt proper to this Text of <hi>Job;</hi> for his Freinds vvere not under that terrible judgement of a totall hiding their hearts from underſtanding; onely the light was with-held from them in and about that tranſaction. As vvhen Chriſt after his reſurrection appeared to thoſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (<hi>Luke</hi> 24.26.) the Text ſaith, <hi>Their eyes were held, that they ſhould not know him.</hi> And (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 31.) <hi>Their eyes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and they knew him:</hi> Thus God at one time holds the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall eye of ſome good men, that they cannot diſcerne ſuch or ſuch a Truth, yet afterwards he opens their eyes and they diſcerne it.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The wiſeſt men doe not ſee all truths, nor are they able to judge of all matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were vviſe men, very vviſe men; they ſpake excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, and very underſtandingly about God, they gave <hi>Job</hi> very good counſell, but yet they failed here. <hi>Elihu (Ch.</hi> 32.9.) ſaith, <hi>Great men are not alwayes wiſe;</hi> vve may ſay vviſe men are not alwayes wiſe: and as <hi>no man is wiſe at all times, ſo there is no man wiſe in all things.</hi> We cannot conclude, that becauſe a man hath given a right judgement in ſome one, or in many points, that therefore we may truſt his deciſions in all points. As God hides all wiſedome from ſome men, ſo he very rarely,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:48478:220"/> if at all, truſts any one man or ſort of men at one time with all vviſedome. <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds were vvell acquainted with, and they have acquainted us with many excellent notions about that great Doctrine of Providence, but they were much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken about the Providence of God with <hi>Job,</hi> nor did they ſhew themſelves acquainted vvith that excellent Deſigne of God in his afflicting Providences, thereby to try the ſtrength and manifeſt the graces vvhich hee hath beſtowed upon his people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The hiding of the heart from, and the opening of the heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, are the worke of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee no further then God gives us light, and ſo farr as he leads us, we goe right; if hee vvithdraw, vve turne aſide, and quickly vvander from the way of truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. We have nothing of our owne but ſin and ignorance, wiſedome is of God; <hi>Every good and perfect gift comes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi> As God hides all Goſpell-truths and myſteries from vvorldly vviſe men; ſo no Goſpell myſterie is knowne to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man till God diſcover and make it knowne (<hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25.) <hi>At that time Jeſus anſwered and ſayd, I thanke thee, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of Heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, but haſt revealed them unto babes.</hi> By vviſe and prudent, he meanes wordly vviſe men, meere Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Politicians, or hypocriticall Profeſſors, ſuch as the Scribes and Phariſees were, from theſe God (in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) hides the things of the Kingdome of Heaven; and reveales them unto Babes, even to ſuch as are at the greateſt diſtance in naturall conſiderations from the capacity of ſuch rich and heavenly manifeſtations. There is no greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that God opens the heart to underſtand, then to ſee Babes underſtand: If true knowledge in ſpirituall myſteries vvere from man, they vvho have moſt of man in them vvould have moſt of that knowledge; but vvee are taught by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that ſuch men as the World calls <hi>Fooles doe not erre in the way of holineſſe (Iſa.</hi> 35.8.) And that the courſe of all Worldly vviſe men, is a continuall erring from that vvay, and that ſome godly men, who are higher by head and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then ſome of their Brethren in naturall wiſedome, have run into, and maintained errors; whither can we aſcribe
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:48478:221"/> all this, but to the power of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſignes and miracles which God wrought in the midſt of that people, vvhich they did not underſtand: Why, what was the reaſon? <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us expreſſely, vvhat, <hi>Yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to conceive, nor eyes to ſee, nor eares to heare to this day (Deut.</hi> 29.4.) They had ſenſitive eyes and eares, yea, they had a rationall heart or minde, but they vvanted a ſpirituall eye to ſee, a ſpirituall care to heare, a ſpirituall heart or minde to apprehend and improve thoſe wonderfull vvorkes of God: And theſe they had not, becauſe God had not given them ſuch eyes, eares, and hearts. Wonders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace, cannot open the eyes fully, but grace without won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders can. And as man hath not an eye to ſee the wonderfull workes of God ſpiritually, untill it is given, ſo, much leſſe hath he an eye to ſee the wonders of the Word of God, till it be given him from above; and therefore <hi>David</hi> prayes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18.) <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wonderous things out of thy Law.</hi> And if the wondrous things of the Law, are not much ſeene till God give an eye, then much leſſe are the vvondrous things of the Goſpell. The light of nature ſhewes us ſomwhat of the Law, but nothing of the Goſpell was ever ſeen by the light of nature: Many who have ſeene and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired ſome excellencies in the Law, could never ſee and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have derided that which is the excellency of the Goſpell, till God hath opened their heart to underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a great judgement to have our hearts hidden from underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the things of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a ſore judgement not to have the light, but it is a ſorer judgement not to ſee by the light when we have it. To have a heart hid from underſtanding, is farr worſe then to have a heart unable to underſtand. Our inability to underſtand, ariſeth two vvayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From a naturall infirmity in the underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the naturall obſcurity of the matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Plaine truthes are not apprehended by a weake underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the ſtrongeſt underſtanding cannot apprehend ſome obſcure truthes, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, that in them <hi>there are ſome things hard to be underſtood</hi>
                     <pb n="433" facs="tcp:48478:221"/> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.) Now as there is an affliction in it, not to be able to underſtand any truth which God hath revealed for our uſe, ſo there is much wrath and judgement in it, when God hides underſtanding from the heart in any of thoſe things which he hath revealed for our uſe, but eſpecially in thoſe things which are neceſſary, eyther to our future, or our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent peace. Thus the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſent to Preach that people blinde, and deafe, and ignorant (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6.9, 10.) <hi>Goe tell this people, Heare yee indeed, but underſtand not, and ſee yee indeed, but perceive not: Make the heart of this people fat, and make their eares heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and underſtand with their hearts, and convert and be healed:</hi> As if the Lord had ſayd, This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall want neither meanes nor Miniſters, neither word nor light; but they ſhall reape no benefit neither by meanes nor Miniſters, neither by word nor light; yea, all theſe meanes ſhall produce contrary effects, they ſhall be hardned and not ſoftned, blinded and not enlightned, their eares ſhall be deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not bored by the Word. They would not heare, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall not; they would not underſtand, therefore they ſhall not be able to underſtand. They who refuſe the offers of mercy, ſhall be deſtroyed with the offers of mercy. And as God doth often take away the Goſpell in wrath, ſo he ſometimes ſends it in wrath. It is a great miſery to have the Goſpell hid from a people for want of revelation, but it is loweſt miſery to have it hid in the revelation. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſignifies, <hi>The viſion or ſight of peace;</hi> and this was the glory of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet at laſt this glory was taken from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though her name continued; <hi>Jeruſalem (the ſight of peace)</hi> could not ſee her peace (<hi>Luke</hi> 19.41, 42, 43.) When Chriſt came neere to Jeruſalem, <hi>He beheld the City, and wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace:</hi> What then? Chriſt ſuppreſſes the happineſſe which they ſhould have enjoyed by ſuch a ſight, with a ſilent admiration; and onely tells them weeping, <hi>But now they are hid from thine eyes;</hi> How hid? Was there no more Preaching in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> no publique Miniſtry after that day? Yes, the whole Colledge of Apoſtles Preached there, and they Preached the things which belonged both to their temporall, and to their eternall peace; yet as the things which belonged
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:48478:222"/> to their eternall peace were hidden from moſt of their eyes, ſo the things vvhich concerned their temporall peace, were hidden from ſo many of their eyes, that their ruine was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable. God hid their heart from underſtanding, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee did not exalt them; yea, therefore hee caſt them downe.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes the ſequell of that ſad diſpenſation to his Freinds, <hi>Thou haſt hid their heart from underſtanding:</hi> What followes?</p>
                  <q>Therefore ſhalt thou not exalt them.</q>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> renders it; <hi>Therefore thou ſhalt not give them Honour:</hi> And is this all; That they ſhall not be exalted or honoured? No, the Negative hath this affirmative in it, Thou wilt therefore caſt them downe, or humble them: As (<hi>Prov.</hi> 17.21.) <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of the Father of a Foole, <hi>Hee that begets a Foole, doth it to his ſorrow, and the Father of a Foole hath no joy:</hi> Is that all, that he hath no joy? No, the meaning is that the Father of a Foole, hath much ſorrow; yea, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of all joy, affirmes more then the feeling of much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for it ſpeakes all ſorrow. So, <hi>to accept perſons in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not good;</hi> that is, It is extreame ill: There is nothing worſe then that, which in this ſenſe is not good. Thus here, thou haſt hid their heart from underſtanding, <hi>therefore ſhalt thou not exalt them:</hi> that is, Thou ſhalt humble and abaſe them; and though Non-exaltation, in this place, doth not carry all kinde, or the extremity of abaſement, yet it carries a very great abaſement: Why? What was this abaſement, or <hi>non-exaltation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may interpret it two vvayes. <hi>Thou ſhalt not exalt them:</hi> that is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thou ſhalt not give them this honour to determine my cauſe; thou wilt take the matter out of their hands into thine owne, or thou wilt put it into ſome other hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou ſhalt not exalt them to the honour of a conqueſt over me,<note place="margin">Hinc colligo te nolle ut de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portata ſuper me victoria glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientur, <hi>Bold.</hi>
                     </note> or to carry the cauſe againſt me; yea, they ſhall be overthrowne, and the cauſe ſhall goe againſt them: Both theſe wayes anſwer the event. <hi>Jobs</hi> three Freinds had neyther the honour to end this controverſie, nor did they at all prevaile in the end; they went not away vvith victory,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:48478:222"/> nor could they glory, that they had got the day of <hi>Job: Thou ſhalt not exalt them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note hence.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Exaltation is from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Promotion comes neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South;</hi> that is, It comes not by the power of any creature, in any coaſt or quarter of the earth. Whence comes it then? The next Verſe directs us, For God is the Judge, he putteth downe one, and ſetteth up another (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.6, 7.) we can no more make our ſelves great men, then wee can make our ſelves men: Our civill frame is as much from God as our naturall; by what hand ſoever we are exalted, it is God that exalts us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God hides underſtanding from them, whom he is about to abaſe, or caſt downe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fall of moſt men is from their owne folly, and uſually God takes away their wiſedome, whoſe honor he takes away. They ſhall not ſee the way to their own preſervation, who are intended for deſtruction. All Ages have taught us this Doctrine in the downefall of the greateſt Princes; who have refuſed all counſels and overtures for their owne good,<note place="margin">Quos perdere vult Jupiter hos dementat.</note> till their evils have proved paſt cure, and themſelves irrecoverably loſt. That vvhich a Child might foreſee, they have had no eyes to ſee, nor hearts to conſider: becauſe God would eyther not exalt them, or not eſtabliſh them in their exaltations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hid their hearts from underſtanding the things of their owne peace. Fooles are not fit to be exalted to high places, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> they made him large promiſes of a reſtauration, that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſhould be like the morning, that he ſhould outſhine the very Sun, and be a great man againe. Thus they ſpake (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) hee looked on all theſe fayre promiſes as flatteries, becauſe in his owne thoughts he was a dead man, and his calamities paſt all hope of recovery in this World. As if hee had ſayd, <hi>Why doe you feed me with ſuch vaine hopes, and propheſie to me of Wine, and of ſtrong drinke, of earthly honour and riches, of length of dayes, and of a multitude of yeares yet behinde in the race of this preſent life; I cannot but call this flattery, and a departure from the laws of freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: For alas! My dayes are extinct, my breath is corrupt, and yet you are telling me of long life, and good dayes in this World.</hi> And indeed this is at once the cuſtome and the fault of many who viſit their Freinds upon the borders of death; they thinke they are not freindly, unleſſe they labour to give them hopes of life, and deliver their opinion peremptorily, <hi>We doubt not but you will doe well enough, you will recover from this ſickneſſe, and getting over this brunt, and ſee many dayes.</hi> This is flattery: it is our duty to ſpeake comfortably to our dying Freinds, to ſet forth the love of God, and his readineſſe to pardon, to prepare them for a better life, and to make their paſſage out of this more eaſie: But when wee ſee them at the Graves mouth; when death is ready to ſeize on them, then to tell them of long life, is rather the office of a Flatterer then of a Freind. We ſhew more love to our dying Freinds, by offering our counſels, and tendering up our prayers for their fitneſſe to depart out of this life, then by ſhewing our deſire, that they ſhould live, and our loathneſſe to part with them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds may be ſayd to ſpeake flattery to God; and then the words are an Argument from the greater to the leſſe; as if he had ſayd, <hi>If he who ſpeakes flattery to his freind, a man like himſelfe, ſhall be puniſhed, then much more ſhall
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:48478:225"/> he, who ſpeakes flattery to God.</hi> But, you will ſay, How can God be flattered? There are two wayes of flattering men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By promiſing them more then we intend.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By applauding them more then they deſerve.</p>
                  <p>When we cry up thoſe for wiſe men who are little guilty of wiſedome; or commend thoſe as good, who are very guilty of evill; both theſe are ſtraines of flattery: It is impoſſible to flatter God in this latter ſenſe, for we cannot ſpeake of God higher then he is; his glory, wiſedome, and goodneſſe, are above, not onely our words, but our thoughts. But we may flatter God in the firſt ſenſe, by promiſing him more then we intend; they on their ſick beds doe but flatter God, who tell him how good, and holy they will be, when their hearts are not right with him: Yet neyther is this the flattery of God which <hi>Job</hi> may be ſuppoſed to ſuggeſt againſt his freinds. The flattery here ſuggeſted, is their juſtifying the proceedings of God in afflicting <hi>Job,</hi> by condemning <hi>Job;</hi> as if there had been no way left to cleare up the righteouſneſſe of God, but by concluding that <hi>Job</hi> was unrighteous: This manner of arguing, <hi>Job</hi> calls, <hi>Speaking wickedly for God, and talking deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for him:</hi> This he alſo calls, <hi>The accepting of his perſon (Ch.</hi> 13.7, 8.) As if they had been the Patrons and Promoters of Gods cauſe and honour, while they thus pleaded againſt <hi>Job,</hi> and layd his honour and innocency in the duſt. That there is a ſinfull flattery of God in ſuch a procedure againſt man, was ſhewed more largely in the place laſt mentioned, to which I referr the Reader for his further ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that ſpeakes flattery to his freind,</hi> What of him? The next words tell us what.</p>
                  <q>The eyes of his Children ſhall faile.</q>
                  <p>But ſhall he himſelfe eſcape? Shall not hee ſmart for it? Saith not the Scripture, <hi>Whatſoever a man ſowes, that ſhall hee reap:</hi> the ſower ſhall be the reaper.</p>
                  <p>This is not ſpoken to free the Flatterer from puniſhment, but to ſhew that more then he ſhall be puniſhed for his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; as he himſelfe ſhall not eſcape, ſo he may bring others alſo into danger with him: As ſin ſpreads it ſelfe in the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of it, ſo in the puniſhments of it. When but one ſins, many may be defiled, and when but one acts a ſin, many may
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:48478:225"/> be endangered; a man knowes not upon how many he may bring evill, when he doth ill himſelfe.</p>
                  <q>The eyes of his Children ſhall faile.</q>
                  <p>What is meant by the failing of the eyes, was ſhewed (<hi>Ch.</hi> 11.20.) where <hi>Zophar</hi> ſaith, <hi>The eyes of the wicked ſhall faile, and their hope ſhall be as the giving up of the ghoſt.</hi> In generall 'tis this, They ſhall be diſappointed of their hopes, or they ſhall expect ſo long and nothing come, that their eyes ſhall faile with expectation, <hi>The eyes of his Children ſhall faile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some by Children, underſtand, not his naturall Children, or the Children of his body, but his Children in a figure,<note place="margin">Morum atque vitae imitatores. <hi>Aquin.</hi>

So they may be called a mans Children, who reſemble him in his manners, as well as they who iſſued from his loynes.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The puniſhment of ſin doth not alway reſt or determine in him that committed the ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The bitter fruits of ſin are often tranſmitted, and handed over to thoſe who had no preſent hand in them when they were committed. The whole Familie, and Poſterity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may ſmart many a day after, and inherit the ſins of their Progenitors, as well as their Lands; when the Father pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth, or provides an Inheritance for his Childe by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or any other indirect way, the eyes of his children may faile for it. I have met with this point before (<hi>Cha.</hi> 15.33, 34.) and elſewhere, therefore I onely touch and paſſe from it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the particular ſin againſt which this judgement is pronounced: It is the ſpeaking of flattery.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſin of flattery is a very provoking ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ſin which ſhall be puniſhed in poſterity, is no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin: Thoſe good actions which the Lord promiſeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in poſterity, or in after times, have a ſpeciall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in them: It ſhewed that the deed of <hi>Jehu,</hi> in deſtroying
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:48478:226"/> 
                     <hi>Ahabs</hi> Houſe, and rooting out his Idolatry (though <hi>Jehu</hi> himſelfe was a very bad man, and did it with a bad heart, yet I ſay, it ſhewed that the deed) was very good, becauſe the Lord promiſed to reward his Children for it, with the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the fourth generation (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.30.) Now as thoſe acts have a great deale of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in them, for which God rewards and bleſſeth to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſo thoſe ſins have a ſpeciall malignity in them, which are threatened and purſued with revenges to Poſterity. Such ſins have a touch of the firſt ſin in them. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin is hereditary to the laſt man; all have ſmarted for that ſin, and the eyes of his Children have failed becauſe he looked upon, and eate the forbidden fruit. Now every ſin which is thus ſpoken of in Scripture, as Idolatry in the ſecond Commandement, and here flattery, hath a ſpeciall ſtampe of the firſt ſin upon it; not onely as being a ſin, and ſo a derivative from it, but as having much of the ſinfulneſſe of that ſin in it: The evils of which did not dye with thoſe who gave it life.</p>
                  <p>And as all flattery is very ſinfull, ſo ſpirituall flattery, or flattery about ſpirituall things is moſt ſinfull; both becauſe about them we ought to be moſt plaine-hearted, and becauſe a deceit about them doth moſt hurt. Any kinde of flattery is bad enough, but this is worſt; ſuch was that of the falfe Prophets, <hi>who daubed with untempered morter, and cryed Peace, peace, when there was no peaee.</hi> Who ſet themſelves to pleaſe, not to inſtruct the people, and were therefore buſie in ſewing pillowes under every elbow. A flatterer would make all men leane ſoft, ſit eaſie, and be well perſwaded of themſelves, though their caſe be ſtarke naught: He that thus ſpeakes flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to his Freind, doth indeed ſpeake miſery, yea, and death to his Freind. The flatterer is the greateſt hater, and no man ſpeakes worſe of another then hee who ſpeakes better of him then he deſerves, or then his ſtate will beare. It is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſpeake all the good of a man that is true, but to ſpeake good of him which is not true, may be his utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</p>
                  <p>And though it hath beene ſayd, and often experienced, that flattery gaines Freinds and Truth-ſpeaking hatred; yet none have run into ſo much hatred as flatterers. For as it is
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:48478:226"/> ſayd of Treaſon, That many love the Treaſon, but all hate the Taytor; ſo many love to heare themſelves flattered, but all hate flatterers. And though true reproofes are bitter Pills, and very diſtaſtfull to moſt in the taking downe, yet wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> hath aſſured us, That, <hi>he that rebuketh a man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhall finde more favour</hi> (even with that man) <hi>then he that flattereth with his lips (Prov.</hi> 28.23.) There are many who as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.2.) <hi>Flatter themſelves,</hi> they are their owne Paraſites. But as they who flatter others, doe moſt commonly fall under their diſpleaſure, ſo all they (ſooner or latter) ſhall fall under their owne diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (and that's worſe then the diſpleaſure of any, yea then of all men) who have flattered themſelves. It is our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and our peace, to be plaine with our ſelves and with all men, how much preſent diſquiet ſo ever we get by it. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes it out to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> (1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5.) <hi>Our exhortation was not of deceit, neyther at any time uſed we flattering words. But as we were allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, even ſo we ſpeake; not as pleaſing men but God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, theſe words may be expounded not as a threat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Freinds for their flattering of him, but as a threat againſt himſelfe, in caſe he ſhould have flattered them. And ſo they carry alſo the weight of a reaſon, why hee uſed ſo much freedome in reproving them, and ſhewing them the danger that hung over their heads: As if he had ſayd, <hi>You my Freinds may perhaps wonder at my boldneſſe and plaineneſſe of ſpeech, while I tell you that God hath hid your hearts from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and that he will not exalt you: But you muſt pardon me, I had rather incurr your frownes by my downeright dealing with you, then Gods by flattering you; I had rather make your eares tingle by reproving you, then make the eyes of my Children ake by my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding you; for this I have learned as a certaine truth, that hee who ſpeakes flattery to his Freind, the eyes of his Children ſhall faile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>That even a godly man doth, and ought to ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in doing his duty, by the remembrance of thoſe evills which are threatned againſt the neglect of it. A Beleever makes uſe of the threatnings, as well as of the promiſes, to keep his heart cloſe in obedience. That is the beſt obedience
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:48478:227"/> which ſprings from the feare of the Lord and his goodneſſe, but that may be a good and a pure act of obedience which ſprings from the feare of the Lord, and his wrath. Chriſt exhorts and <hi>forewarnes his freinds to feare him, who after hee hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell (Luke</hi> 12.5.) 'Tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and moſt ſpirituall, to obey God for himſelfe, without reſpect eyther to Heaven or Hell; yet wee may have reſpect both to Heaven and Hell, to reward and puniſhment in our obedience. <hi>Joſeph</hi> reſiſted temptation by the higheſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he ſayd, <hi>How can I doe this great evill and ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? (Gen.</hi> 39.9) He reſiſts temptation by a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, who ſaith, How can I ſin againſt God, which will doe ſo much evill to my ſelfe, or draw many evils upon mine? And thus <hi>Job</hi> argued according to this interpretation, when he ſayd, <hi>He that ſpeakes flattery to his freind, the eyes of his Children ſhall faile:</hi> Or, as Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>The eyes of the given that way</hi> (that is, to flattery) <hi>ſhall be conſumed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having thus complained againſt, and taxed his Freinds of flattery, goes on to aggravate the ſadneſſe of his condition, and upon the whole, to move the Lord to haſten an end of his miſeries, or to haſten his end, eyther to determine them, or to determine him.</p>

               <p>The ſecond, what it wrought upon himſelfe.</p>
               <p>What his affliction wrought in others, is ſet forth (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 6.) <hi>He was become the talke of all, poſſibly, the ſport of not a few.</hi> The argument ſtands thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That is a very great affliction, which every man ſpeakes of, or which makes a man a by-word.</hi>

                  <hi>Therefore my affliction is very great.</hi>

               <p>As if he had ſayd, <hi>Should I hold my peace and ſit downe in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, yet my dim eyes and dryed bones, my withered skin and crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led limbes, are as ſo many tongues, yea trumpets, to ſpeake and ſpeake aloud the ſorrows of my heart, and the ſufferings of my outward man.</hi> This ſeemes to be <hi>Jobs</hi> ſcope in the words now under hand.</p>

                  <p>And as hee is proverbially ſpoken of for his ſuffering, ſo likewiſe for his holineſſe, God made his Piety a Proverbe too, though his Freinds ſuſpected him for an Hypocrite. When the Lord would ſhew himſelfe ſo unalterably reſolved, that nothing ſhould take him off from bringing judgement upon a ſinfull people, he ſaith, I will not doe it, though <hi>Noah, Daniel, and Job ſtood before me (Ezek,</hi> 14.14.) As if he had ſayd, I will not doe it, though the moſt eminent men in holineſſe, or the greateſt favorites that ever I had in the World ſhould ſue that they might be ſpared; if any in the World could obtaine this of God, <hi>Noah, Daniel, and Job</hi> could, but they ſhould not, therefore none ſhall.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As ſignifying what is or hath been done in the preſence of others, <hi>Before them I was as a Tabret:</hi> Wee put in the Margin, <hi>Before their face, or in their ſight;</hi> that is, They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſſes of it, <hi>I was as a [Tabret.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Vulgar Latine tranſlates the word which wee render <hi>Tabret,</hi> an <hi>Example, I am a by-word and an example before them;</hi> which is a good ſenſe; and then the word <hi>Tophet</hi> (of which more by and by) is uſed for <hi>Mophet,</hi> which ſignifies a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or ſome ſtrange unuſuall thing which appeares, or is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the admiration of all beholders and hearers. I am a Proverbe, and a ſtrange example: Strange examples grow often into a Proverbe. So the Greek expreſſeth it; and we in Engliſh ſay to a man who hath offended greatly, <hi>You ſhall be made an example;</hi> that is, You ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed <hi>(Mat.</hi> 1.19) <hi>Joſeph</hi> being very tender of the honour of <hi>Mary</hi> his eſpouſed Wiſe, perceiving that ſhee was with Childe before they came together, he was loath to make her a <hi>Paradigme, or an example,</hi> of diſhoneſty and diſloyalty; he was unwilling to
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:48478:230"/> make her a publique example, and therefore <hi>was minded to put her away privily,</hi> till the Lord gave him warning in a dreame about it: So ſaith <hi>Job</hi> here, according to this rendring, I am a by-word among the people, and as it were, a Paradigme, a publique example. Great afflictions have theſe three things in them, in reference to others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are a wonder to others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are a terrour to others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are an inſtruction unto others.</p>
                  <p>Wee finde all theſe and more in one Verſe (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.15.) <hi>So it ſhall be a reproach and a taunt, an inſtruction and an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the Nations round about thee, when I ſhall execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in thee in anger, and in fury, and in furious rebuke, I the Lord have ſpoken it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> deſcribing the judgements of God, firſt upon the Angels, ſecondly upon the old World, and laſtly, upon <hi>Sodome,</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> ſaith, that, <hi>God turning the Cities of Sodome and Gomorah into aſhes, condemned them with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, making them an enſample to thoſe that after ſhould live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6.) The burning of thoſe five Cities by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate fire from Heaven, made them examples, or inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all ſucceeding Generations; we may read the odiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe ſins, and the ſeverity of God againſt them, by the light of that fire to this very day. Great afflictions are teaching afflictions; <hi>Thoſe calamities which deſtroy ſome ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct all:</hi> We are not onely to admire and wonder at them, to be amazed and terrified at them, but to be taught and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by them. So the Apoſtle concludes concerning the ſeverall judgements which God brought upon the Jewes, while they murmured and diſobeyed him in the Wilderneſſe: <hi>All theſe things happened to them for examples</hi> (or types) <hi>and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.) There are two ſorts of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples written in the Word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There are examples for our imitation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are examples for our caution.</p>
                  <p>Some are examples by the good which they have done, theſe muſt be imitated; others are examples by the evils which they have ſuffered, by theſe we muſt be warned: This tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Text intends <hi>Job</hi> an example of Caution.</p>

                  <p>Againe, <hi>Aforetime I was as a Tabret;</hi> that is, Aforetime I was in good repute, or I was pleaſant company: As if hee had ſayd, <hi>I am now derided, mocked at, and toſſed upon the tongues of men, yea, I am now voted an Hypocrite, though heretofore in my proſperity, report gave a very pleaſant ſound of me, though abſent, and my perſon was as welcome to them as a Tabret. To ſpeake of mee where I came not was muſick, and I was muſicke whereſoever I came; but now what am I? A by-word, muſicke ſtill if you will, but in ſcorne, a ſong of diſgrace.</hi> That's the firſt ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence take one Obſervation, before I proceed to further explication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The affections and opinions of men are very variable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am now a By-word, before time I was as a Tabret. As the eſtates of men change, ſo uſually doe our opinions of them. <hi>Jobs</hi> heart was the ſame as before, he was as holy as ever hee was, onely he was not ſo wealthy as he was, his ſpirit was as full of grace as before, onely his Purſe was not ſo full of Gold as before; he had not ſo many thouſand Sheep, nor ſo many hundred Oxen, he had not ſuch a Family, and retinue, ſuch worldly riches and honour, and becauſe hee endured ſuch a change in his condition, ſee what a change he ſuffered in mens affections, he that before was as a <hi>Tabret,</hi> all were glad of him, is now <hi>a by-word,</hi> the ſcorne of all.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt giveth teſtimony of <hi>John Baptiſt (John</hi> 5.35.) <hi>He was a burning, and a ſhining light;</hi> and what followes? <hi>And you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in him for a ſeaſon.</hi> Though <hi>John</hi> did burne and ſhine all the while which God continued him in the Candleſtick of the Church with equall heat and luſtre, yet they rejoyced in him but for a while, or <hi>for a ſeaſon.</hi> The Jewes changed their thoughts of <hi>John,</hi> and their eſteeme of him was weakned, though <hi>John</hi> continued in the ſame ſtrength of parts and gifts: Then, how would they have changed if <hi>John</hi> had changed. The peoples hearts were flatted towards him, though his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were not; <hi>John</hi> had not that repute and honour after a few yeares which hee had at the firſt. And the word in the Goſpel which we tranſlate to <hi>rejoyce,</hi> comes neere the word which we have in this Text, <hi>a Tabret;</hi> for it ſignifies to leape and dance; and the Tabret is a muſicall Inſtrument, at the ſound of which men dance and leape; for a time they leaped <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bout <hi>John;</hi> he was a burning and ſhining light, and they
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:48478:231"/> danced and skipped about him, as Children doe about a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing fire in the Streets, but this was onely for a ſeaſon: <hi>John</hi> himſelfe found the World a changling, his followers kept no conſtant tenour towards him, how conſtant ſoever his tenour was. How great a change did Chriſt himſelfe finde; <hi>Hee is yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for ever,</hi> yet one day the Jewes cry <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> they will needs make him a King, he had much adoe to keep himſelfe from a Crowne; the ayre eccoes with <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord:</hi> yet preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the cry was, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him, he is not worthy to live,</hi> he could not keep himſelfe (by all his power as man) from a Croſſe; a murtherer is preferred before him, <hi>Not this man, but Barrabas.</hi> We read (<hi>Acts</hi> 14.) how ſuddenly the Tyde and Streame of affections turned, and how opinions varyed about <hi>Paul;</hi> when he and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had wrought a great cure, the people came and would needs adore them and offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and ſayd, <hi>The Gods are come downe in the likeneſſe of men;</hi> They brought Oxen and Garlands, and would needs worſhip them, there was much adoe to ſtave them off from Deifying, or making Gods of them, and yet before that Chapter is at an end, their acceptation of him was at an end; and <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtoned as unworthy the ſociety of men, by the ſame men, and in the ſame place where he was ſaluted as a God. It is no new thing in the World, to ſee thoſe a <hi>by-word</hi> of the people, who even now were their <hi>Tabret:</hi> to adore one while, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe another, to applaud to day, and to diſlike to morrow, now to ſmile, and anon to frowne, is the conſtant inconſtancy of the creature.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, <hi>Live not upon the breath of men, upon popular ayre, or the ſpeech of people:</hi> Though to have credit with men be a bleſſing, yet let us live upon the credit which we have with God, and rejoyce onely in his eſteeme. Moſt men are full of change, and are apt to vary their aſpects every moment, their affections are as moveable as their outward condition is. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God never alters his opinion of any man, he never rejects where he hath accepted, nor caſts off where he hath embraced, once a freind and alwayes a freind, once pleaſed with us and alwayes pleaſed with us; yea God is pleaſed with his while he manifeſts a fatherly diſpleaſure againſt them; and they are as a Tabret to him while he makes them a By-word among
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:48478:232"/> the people. <hi>Job</hi> was a Tabret in the eares of God, when he was a By-word among the people.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe a Tabret or Drum is empty of all but ayre, and giveth nothing but a ſound; ſome interpret thus, <hi>I am before them as an empty Veſſell, or as one who hath nothing in him but winde, and from whom nothing comes but a ſound of words;</hi> that is, They looke upon me as a man of no reall worth. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, that though hee ſpake <hi>with the tongues of men and Angels;</hi> that is, With the moſt excellent tongues. Angels have no tongues, nor have they any faces as men have, yet in Scripture, the face of an Angell is put for the moſt beautifull face, and the tongue of an Angell for the moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent tongue among all the children of m n: Now ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> though I had the tongue of Angels, or men, and were the beſt ſpeaker that ever was, yet (being voyd of true charity) <hi>I ſhould become as a ſounding braſſe and a tinckling Cimball</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1.) Such <hi>a tinckling Cimball</hi> was <hi>Job</hi> eſteemed, a Drum full of ayre, or an <hi>empty Veſſell,</hi> as Jeruſalem was left by the King of Babylon (<hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, Some both of the Rabbins and latter Writers tell us,<note place="margin">Exiſtimant eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe vocem Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicam quae ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num vel prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem. q. d.</hi> qui princeps e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram factus ſum in proverbium &amp; fabulam. <hi>Rab. Lev. Vatabl.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>Tophet</hi> is a Chaldee word, ſignifying <hi>Lord, or a Prince:</hi> And they referr us for a confirmation to (<hi>Dan.</hi> 3.2.) Where we finde the word put into the Summons which <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> ſent to his Nobles and great Officers, for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance at the dedication of the Image which he had ſet up: We render it, <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> whether our word hits that is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but without doubt it ſignifies ſuch as were in high Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, being there marſhall'd before the Rulers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                  <p>Taking this interpretation of the word, <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning is, <hi>I am now a proverbe,</hi> or a man of no credit, <hi>though heretofore I was as a Prince, or a Ruler in their preſence.</hi> Some reject this becauſe the mixture of the Chaldee with the Hebrew, was long after <hi>Jobs</hi> time, which yet may eaſily be reconciled. And the ſenſe is good, being indeed the ſame in ſubſtance with the ſecond Expoſition.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This word <hi>Tophet</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Drum,</hi> or (as we) a Tabret, which is a ſmaller Drum (for there is the <hi>Martiall Drum,</hi> or the Drum of Warr, and the Tabret, which is a <hi>Mirth Drum,</hi> a Drum uſed at ſports, and dancing, this
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:48478:232"/> word I ſay) gives denomination to a place very famous or infamous rather in the Scripture of the Old Teſtament: A part of good <hi>Joſiah</hi> his reformation is thus deſcribed (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.10.) <hi>And he defiled</hi> (in the opinion of Idol-worſhippers, though indeed the pureſt worſhip uſed there, was more filthy then any filth which <hi>Joſiah</hi> threw into it, He, ſaith the Text defiled) <hi>Tophet which is in the Valley of the Children of Hinnon, that no man might make his Sons and Daughters paſſe through the fire to Moloch.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> complained of, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that place (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7.31, 32) <hi>They have built the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Tophet which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnon, to burne their Sons and Daughters in the fire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now, the reaſon why that place was called <hi>Tophet,</hi> from the word in the Text, aroſe thus, becauſe when the Jewes in thoſe abominable Idolatries offered their owne Children, the fruit of their bodies, in ſacrifice to <hi>Moloch,</hi> the reputed God of the Moabites and Ammonites, who was ſo called from <hi>Malac,</hi> ſignifying to rule or reigne (for as all Idols would rule as Kings, ſo this was a cheife, <hi>a King Idol;</hi> hence ſome conceive <hi>Moloch</hi> to be the ſame with <hi>Baal,</hi> which is alſo a name of ſupremacy, ſignifying <hi>Lord, or Maſter</hi>) This <hi>Moloch</hi> was an hollow Image of Braſſe, into which they put much fire, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the face of a Bullock, and hands ſpread abroad like a Man: He had ſeven Chappels, and whoſoever offered his Son to him entred into the ſeventh; which when any did, they uſed to beat upon Drums and Tabrets,<note place="margin">Barathrum quod ſupplicii locus erat apud Athenienſes, pro inferno uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, That the torture was by beating with Staves, or Cudgels.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That it was not uſuall for men to dye under ſuch beatings, that puniſhment not being to death, but to paine and diſgrace; as appeares alſo from that of <hi>Pilate</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, who when he found nothing in him worthy of death, ſayd, <hi>I will chaſtiſe</hi> (or beat) <hi>him, and releaſe him (Luke</hi> 23.15, 16.)

                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> alſo may thought be to allude to this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome (<hi>Na.</hi> 2.7.) <hi>And Huzzab</hi> (which ſome take for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of the Queene of <hi>Ninevie) ſhall be led away Captive, ſhe ſhall be brought up, and her Maids ſhall lead her as with the voice of Doves, tabring</hi> (or drumming) <hi>upon their breaſts,</hi> it is this word in the Text; that is, They ſhall inflict that puniſhment upon themſelves, which others uſe to inflict on evill doers; as if he had ſayd, They ſhall torture themſelves, or be their owne tormentors for very griefe and vexation at thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which their enemies ſhall bring upon them.

The diſhonour of ſuch a ſuffering is a greater puniſhment to a great King, then the paine of it, yet he cannot be diſpenſed with, <hi>yea for the King it is prepared. The pile of it is fire, and much wood:</hi> What's the meaning of that? My Author anſwers, This puniſhment of drumming was ſometims but preparatory another: firſt they were beaten, and then they were burned; and therefore (ſaith he) before the Engine a great fire was made, into which when they were tortured by beating, offenders were caſt and conſumed to aſhes.<note place="margin">Jubet amoveri noxialem ſtipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem plebeia cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum paena me damnet virum. <hi>Prud. in Rom.

                     </note> Our Martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logyes tell us of ſome, who have been firſt hanged, and then burned; and ordinarily among us, when Traytors are put to death, a fire is made at the place of Execution, into which their bowells are caſt, when their bodies are cut up and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.

                  <p>But here it may be demanded, Did any of the Kings of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria, who captivated and afflicted the Jewes, ſuffer ſuch a kinde of death as this?

                  <p>As this Interpretation of the Prophet gives much light to that of <hi>Job,</hi> ſo it is an ingenious conjecture upon that place, and carries a faire correſpondence both to truth and reaſon. Nor is there (that I have met with) any Interpreter who
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:48478:235"/> doth not underſtand that Text of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in its firſt and literall ſenſe, of the temporary judgements which God threatned to powre out upon the State and King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as moſt in a Tropologicall and Alluſive ſenſe, Interpret it of eternall judgement in Hell, which is indeed a <hi>fiery Tophet,</hi> and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of old, yea for the King it is prepared, for the great King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> as well as for the meaneſt perſon.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſeventh Tranſlation and Expoſition of theſe words which takes the former part of the Verſe as was toucht upon the laſt, and reads the whole thus; <hi>For he will make me a Governour among the people,</hi>

                  <p>This reading riſes cleerely enough from the words of the Text, yet I have one exception againſt it, as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tenour of <hi>Jobs</hi> profeſſion; who though he were full of Faith in God, that it ſhould goe well with him for eternity, yet hee conſtantly diſclaimes any hope of reſtauration to a temporall greatneſſe; and having ſayd at the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>My dayes are extinct, the Graves are ready for me,</hi> it ſeemes unſuitable to ſay h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thoſe afflictions which make others laugh, make us moſt mournefull: when <hi>Nero</hi> had ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, hee made himſelfe muſick at it, and that calamity upon the City, was as a Tabret to him, while they were ſorrowing, he was ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As to rejoyce at the evill which others ſuffer is baſe joy, the worſt of joyes in it ſelfe, ſo it makes the evills which wee ſuffer worſe to our apprehenſion. The Prophet laments o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe of this (<hi>Lament.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>All that paſſe by, clap their hands at thee, they hiſſe and wagg their head at the Daughter of Jeruſalem, ſaying, Is this the City that men call the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth? All thine enemies have opened their mouth againſt thee, they hiſſe and gnaſh the teeth, they ſay, We have ſwallowed her up certainely, this is the day that we looked for, we have found, we have ſeene it. Jeruſalem</hi> was as much burdened with her Enemies joy, as with her owne ſorrows. If when we mourne, wee have ſome to mourne with us, wee are comforted in our mournings; but when God leaves us to the ſcorne and contempt of men, when they make themſelves merry with our troubles, and exult at our calamities, when our teares are as Wine to them, and the Bread of our affliction becomes the Bread of their deſire, this renders our ſorrowes out of meaſure ſorrowfull. Hence <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 25.2.) prayes ſo hard, <hi>Lord let not mine Enemy tryumph over me:</hi> It is eaſier to loſe a Battel, yea to dye in Battel, then to be led in tryumph, or to be triumphed over after the battel: <hi>David</hi> being freed from that feare, gathers a ſtrong argument that God had reſpect to him (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.11.) <hi>By this I know that thou favoureſt me, becauſe mine Enemy doth not tryumph over me,</hi> It is greateſt mercy when we tryumph over our Enemies, but it is great mercy when God delivers us from being tryumphed over by our Enemies, for as the mercies of the wicked, ſo the joyes of the mercileſſe are cruell.

                     </note> to ſeeme tranſlated from the dunghill to the Throne, from a ſtate of greateſt contempt to a ſtate of higheſt honour. Good men ſhall glorifie God in me, and ſhall rejoyce at the downfall of Hypocrites; but though the event did verifie this, <hi>Job</hi> was at the laſt reſtored, and was made as a Prince among the people, and his reſtauration was ſuch as might juſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh and draw all that eyther ſaw or heard of it into admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet I much doubt whether <hi>Job</hi> had any ſuch ſcope in theſe words, which rather continue and heighten the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of his then preſent troubles, then hold out any inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of his hope, much leſſe of his aſſurance of a raiſing to a future worldly proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some conceive this matter of aſtoniſhment to be the patience of <hi>Job</hi> under his ſufferings, that hee ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and hold out in ſuch extremities, till his <hi>eye was dym by reaſon of ſorrow, and his members were like a ſhadow: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright men ſhall be aſtonied at this;</hi> Is it not marvellous that a man ſhould act a life of grace, when it could ſcarſe be perceived that he acted the life of nature? As God doth often worke miraculouſly for the deliverance of his people out of trouble, ſo they ſometimes (by his power) worke miraculouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der troubles, before deliverance comes. Such patience, ſuch humility, ſuch meekneſſe, and faith, are recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as have cauſed upright men to ſtand aſtonied.

                  <p>Some providences of God put the wiſeſt to a ſtand; not onely are Fooles and wicked men, but men of the greateſt experience and underſtanding in the wayes of God, ſo puzzled that they know not what to ſay, or how to anſwer?

                  <p>Now, <hi>If the providences of God be ſuch a deep, that upright wiſe men are aſtonied at them, then what a deep are the counſels and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God?</hi> Providences are the diſpenſations of God to the eye, they are the objects of ſenſe, if we cannot ſee to the end of that which is before us, as providences are, how ſhall vvee ſee the end of that which is ſo farr off from us as the Counſels and Decrees of God are? The Apoſtle ſtood as a man aſtonied at both (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.) vvhen hee had ſpoken of that ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing diſpenſation of God in caſting off the Jewes, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Gentiles, he cryes out, <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God: How unſearchable are his judgements;</hi> and among them, this ſpeciall judgement in taking the Goſpell from the Jews, and breaking them off, who were the naturall branches, that the Gentiles who were the wilde Olive might be graffed in: <hi>How unſearchable is this judgement, and this way of God paſt finding out; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright men are aſtonied at this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How ſtrange ſoever the dealings of God are with his, yet righteous men are onely aſtoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>They are not ſcandalized, they are not offended at God for them, they doe not blaſpheme the name, or apoſtatize from the wayes of God, nor doe they quarrell at his diſpenſations. For as when they are aſtoniſhed at the proſperity of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they preſerve high and holy thoughts of God, and onely ſeek reſolution at the mouth of God: as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did (<hi>Ch.</hi> 12.1.) <hi>Lord thou art righteous, yet let me reaſon with thee, Why doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> Or as <hi>Habakkuk (Chap.</hi> 2.2.) propounds his queſtion to finde out the knot in the wayes and dealings of God: Now I ſay, as it is thus with the righteous, when they ſee the great proſperity of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſo when they ſee the greateſt adverſities of the godly,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:48478:240"/> they are onely amazed at the dealings of God, they doe not deſpond, much leſſe blaſpheme becauſe of his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alings. But when carnall men ſee thoſe who have gone for righteous or upright, under afflictions, they run into deſperate extreames.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They deſpiſe and ſleight them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They judge them Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They look upon them as the moſt miſerable men in the World: <hi>Afflicted grace and innocence hath no beauty in a carnall eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They judge hardly of God, who deales thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely with men; what? Are theſe the ſervants of God, and doth he uſe them thus? Doth hee recompenſe them thus for the paines which they have taken, and for the worke which they have done him?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They grow into an abhorrence of holineſſe, and into a diſtaſte of Religion it ſelfe. If God pay his Servants wages in ſuch coyne as this (ſay they) let who ſo will ſerve him, we are not ambitious of his Livery. If this be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Profeſſors (as you call them) let who vvill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe; thus they are ſcandalled and offended.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtoryed, that when <hi>Aygoland</hi> a King of the Moores (who had long maintained Warr againſt <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> hoping to make a fairer agreement with him) had promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Chriſtian Faith, and be Baptized, he comming with a gallant retinue to the French Court, ſaw there a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of poore men fed and cloathed by the Emperours charity,<note place="margin">Aygolandus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecto ſervorum Dei ſtatu offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus a Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae fidei profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione abſtinuit. <hi>Lampad. in Sleyd. part. 3.</hi>
                     </note> and enquiring who they were, it was anſwered, <hi>That they were the Servants of God:</hi> What, ſayd he, Are the Emperours Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſo rich and brave, and are the Servants of God ſo poor and ſqualid? I had a purpoſe to be baptized, but now I am reſolved never to ſerve that God, who keepes and rewards his Servants no better. What this King ſpake out, many ſpeake in their hearts; they will not ſerve Chriſt upon ſelfe-denying and ſuffering termes.</p>
                  <p>As when the Croſſe falls upon Hypocrites, they depart from the Faith, and (with <hi>Demas</hi>) imbrace this preſent World; they will not endure a ſtorme for Chriſt, nor haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their worldly poſſeſſions for all the promiſes in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; ſo when the godly fall under croſſes and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Goſpell, evill and prophane men reject it, they
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48478:241"/> will none of it: The righteous may be aſtonied and wonder, but the wicked blaſpheme <hi>at this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good men are apt to have ſtrange thoughts about afflictions and croſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They who are well acquainted with the Theory of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet vvhen they come to ſuffer indeed, finde much loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and averſeneſſe to it. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw this and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to remove it (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>My brethren, thinke it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tryall, as if ſome ſtrange thing had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to you, but rejoyce, &amp;c.</hi> They looked ſtrange on tryals, as if they had never ſeen nor heard of them before: They knew not how to digeſt ſuch hard-meate as ſufferings are, under the profeſſion of the Goſpell; their hearts were ſomewhat cold to thoſe ſires, and they had no minde to come neere leſt they ſhould burne their fingers, and were therefore warned, <hi>Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tryall. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet deſcribes him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3.) <hi>was a man of ſorrow and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with griefe.</hi> Chriſt and griefe were no ſtrangers, why then ſhould a Chriſtian thinke ſtrange of it? The Apoſtle u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that argument (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 13.) <hi>But rejoyce in as much as yee are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings:</hi> Ours are the ſufferings of Chriſt, not onely becauſe we ſuffer for him, and hee ſuffers with us, but becauſe hee ſuffered the ſame things, yea farre greater both before us and for us: Chriſt tooke our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon him, when he tooke our nature upon him, yet our nature thinks ſtrange to partake in the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 3.3, 4.) tells the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that he ſent <hi>Timotheus</hi> to eſtabliſh them, and to comfort them concerning their Faith, <hi>That no man ſhould be moved by theſe afflictions:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>q. d.</hi> Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum juſtorum jam nobis cauſa &amp; ratio ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorata eſt; at quondam ut pote ignota, multam admirandi &amp; philoſophandi materiam ipſis juſtis praebebat.</note> Intimating that the beſt of men, the beſt of Saints are apt to be moved by afflictions; he meanes it of an inward motion, that is, to have their ſpirits diſturbed and troubled, as <hi>Davids</hi> was vvhen he put thoſe queſtions to his ſoule (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11.) <hi>Why art thou caſt downe O my ſoule, and why art thou diſquieted within me? But why ſhould no man be moved by thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions? The Apoſtle ſhewes why, For your ſelves know that wee were alſo appointed thereto: for verily when I was with you I told you before that we muſt ſuffer tribulations, as it came to paſſe, and yee know it. Paul</hi> gave them notice before affliction came, leſt
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48478:241"/> they ſhould be moved when they were come. Thus Chriſt warned his Diſciples. and he warned them for this end (<hi>John</hi> 16.1.) <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you that you be not offended:</hi> What things were theſe? <hi>They</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall put you out of the Synagogues; yea, the time commeth, that whoſoever killeth you, will thinke that he doth God ſervice:</hi> Chriſt foreſaw that when theſe things came they would finde worke enough to quiet their ſpirits in, and to quit themſelves from trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome motions: And as Chriſt to keep or make their hearts quiet, tells them of their ſufferings aforehand, ſo hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tells them that hee himſelfe had ſuffered before hand (<hi>John</hi> 15.18.) <hi>If the World hate you, you know it hated me before it hated you;</hi> you know it, and knowing it, you ought not be troubled when you meet with hatred in the World: The Servant muſt not expect better uſage then his Maſter. When we ſee ſo much layd in to fortifie our ſpirits againſt outward croſſes, in, or for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, it is an aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant argument that our hearts are apt to ſtartle, and we to be aſtonied at them.</p>

And if they ſay (of this Sword) as (<hi>Jer.</hi> 47.6.) <hi>O thou Sword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet?</hi> We muſt anſwer as the Sword doth there, <hi>How can I be quiet ſeeing the Lord hath given me a charge againſt Aske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon?</hi> The Sword of that Warr receives its Commiſſion from God, and is deſigned now to one coaſt, anon to another: The Sword of this Warr hath long ſince received its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God, againſt all the coaſts of ſin, and powers of darkneſſe, nor can it be quiet, or put it ſelfe up in its Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard while there is an Hypocrite appearing upon the face of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Gods quarrell muſt be perpetuated, it can never be taken up, <hi>Let them returne to thee, but returne not thou to them,</hi> was the Prophets charge (<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19.) There's no compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this difference; they muſt returne and give themſelves up to God, and his wayes, elſe we cannot give them an inch of ground, or make truce with them for an houre, much leſſe may we make peace with them, or give them the right hand of fellowſhip.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Here we have the Hypocrite in his flouriſh, and the innocent in his affliction, the Hypocrite aloft, and the innocent below; yet when it is thus, even then the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is deſcribed ſtirring up himſelfe againſt the Hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A godly man afflicted, doth not at all approve or applaud the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, but oppoſeth him in his greateſt pompe and worldly ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the wicked are at the higheſt, even as happy as the World can make them, yet a godly man will not change ſtates with them, or (as we ſay) turne Tables with them; he would not have his outward proſperity, with his heart, if it were worth ten thouſand Worlds: <hi>He ſees and knowes there is more excellency and worth in afflicted grace, then in the moſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous wickedneſſe:</hi> The love of God is better then life, and if ſo, what are all the things of this life compared to it? Hence a godly man hath no better opinion of the wicked in
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:48478:243"/> riches, then in poverty, and hee hath no worſe opinion of himſelfe when he is poore then when he was rich: Hee doth not account grace the leſſe glorious, becauſe it hath ſo little of outward glory upon it.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing he will not change ſtates with him, he cannot envy him: We envy thoſe only whom we judge in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then our ſelves. <hi>David</hi> under a temptation, <hi>was envious at the fooliſh, when he ſaw the proſperity of the wicked (P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>al.</hi> 73.2, 3.) and his feet were almoſt gone, his ſteps had well-nigh ſlipt, but when he recollected himſelfe, and went to the Sanctuary, ſuch thoughts were quickly downe, and envy was extinct, he ſaw much matter enough to pitty wicked men, but none to envy them, they ſtand in ſlippery places, and are ſuddenly caſt downe. <hi>How are they brought into deſolation, as in a moment they are utterly conſumed with terrours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as he doth not envy them, ſo thirdly, much leſſe doth he imitate them, he is ſo farr from imitating them, that hee ſets himſelfe to oppoſe them, and he oppoſeth them all thoſe ways, and with all thoſe weapons that God hath put into his hand: He oppoſeth ever him by counſell and conviction, by reproofes and prayers. And as he fights againſt the Hypocrite by prayer, ſo by prayer he fortifies himſelfe againſt all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full complyances with him.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> prayed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.4.) <hi>Incline not my heart to any evill thing, to practice wicked workes with men that worke ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and let me not eate of their dainties:</hi> As if hee had ſayd, <hi>Though wicked men be fine-fed, and dyet upon dainties every day, though they devoure the fatt, and drinke the ſweet, and have all things that their hearts can deſire, yet Lord ever keep me from the practice of wicked workes with men that worke iniquity, and let me not eate of their dainties, who finde a ſweetneſſe in ſin, and take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the counſell of the wiſe man (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10, 11.) <hi>My Son if ſinners entice thee, conſent thou not:</hi> Doe not aſſociate with them, they will tell thee of great matters; they will ſay, <hi>Come let us lay wait for blood, we ſhall fill our houſes with ſpoyle; caſt in thy lot among us, let us all have one purſe, My Son, walke not thou in the way with them, refraine thy foot from their paths; for their feet run to evill,</hi> &amp;c. He that would refraine his foot from walking in, muſt firſt refraine his heart from approving of, the paths of wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:48478:244"/>
                  <p>This the innocent doth and more, while he ſtirreth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt the Hypocrite. And as he ſets himſelfe againſt the way of the Hypocrites, ſo he labours to ſet forward with all his might in the way of holineſſe, for that's his way, as appeares in the next Verſe.</p>

And he anſwers about things, <hi>Shall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, ſhall theſe ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> That is, Eyther from that love which we beare to Chriſt, or from that love that Chriſt beares to us; what ſhall make Chriſt out of love with us?

Whether the Lord calls us to paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or to active, hee is wiſe and faithfull to proportion, and give out ſuitable ability. It is not from the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Free-will, but from the freſh annoyntings of the ſpirit, <hi>that we are ſtrengthned with might in the inner man (Eph.</hi> 3.16.) And againe (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.12.) <hi>We are ſtrengthened with all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience, and long-ſufferance with joyfulneſſe.</hi> Affliction it ſelfe cannot ſtrengthen us in grace, it rather weakens us; the increaſe of ſtrength flowes from the ſame Fountaine, whence wee had the firſt ſtrength: All is from God. <hi>In the Lord have we righteouſneſſe and ſtrength (Iſa.</hi> 45.24.) And <hi>he is an everlaſting ſtrength, the rock of Ages (Iſa.</hi> 26.4.) As he is an everlaſting ſtrength in
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48478:248"/> himſelfe, ſo he is to his people: And the reaſon why his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are everlaſtingly ſtrong, is, becauſe he is ſo, <hi>Even the youths ſhall faint and be weary, and the young men ſhall utterly fall, but they that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, and they ſhall walke and not faint (Iſa.</hi> 40.30, 31.) But why ſhall the youths faint, and the young men utterly fall? Are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners in grace as ſure to be upheld as the ancient or men of dayes? And why is fainting and falling, the lot of youths and young men, who are ſuppoſed in their ſpirituall capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or in their naturall, to have the greateſt ſtrength? The Apoſtle <hi>Johns</hi> experience of the young men ſeemes to differ very much from this Propheſie of them, <hi>I write unto you young men</hi> (ſaith he, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>becauſe yee are ſtrong, and the Word of God abideth in you, and yee have overcome the wicked one.</hi> How doth <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſay, the young men ſhall utterly fall, and yet <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>They have overcome the wicked one?</hi> that is, The Devill. Every Victory is an argument of ſtrength, eſpecially a victory over him who is very ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The Prophet and the Apoſtle doe not ſpeake of the ſame young men: The Prophets young men are any men that boaſt of their owne ſtrength in ſpiritualls, and truſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; theſe of what age ſoever they be, he calls young men, not becauſe like young men they have a reall great ſtrength, but becauſe (which young men are very apt to doe in the ſtrength they have) they truſt in a ſtrength which indeed they have not; ſo that theſe are called young men, becauſe they boaſt of, and truſt in their ſuppoſed ſtrength, not becauſe they are really very ſtrong; and therefore theſe young men ſhall not onely faint, but utterly fall. But the Apoſtle <hi>Johns</hi> young men, are ſuch as have much ſtrength in them, and yet live, and walke and fight in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt; theſe young men are ſo farr from falling utterly, that they ſhall ſtand for ever, and all their enemies ſhall eyther flee or fall before them, becauſe as the battell reneweth, ſo Chriſt will renew their ſtrength, and recruit their hearts with further ayd at every further charge.</p>
                  <p>Onely by going out of our owne ſtrength we get ſtrength, that was <hi>Pauls</hi> experience of himſelfe (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10.) <hi>When I am weake, then I am ſtrong;</hi> that is, When I am weake
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:48478:249"/> in my ſelfe, and have low thoughts of my owne ſtock, then ſtrength is ſent me in; and I am ſupported by an Almighty power, when I ſee that I have no might: <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>moſt gladly will I rejoyce in my infirmities, that the ſtrength of Chriſt may reſt on me: Paul</hi> was no ſooner convinced that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He that lives upon the grace received from Chriſt, and not upon the grace in Chriſt, ſhall quickly feele a want of grace, and a decay of ſpirituall life.</p>
                  <p>Now, if grace received from Chriſt be not ſtock enough to live and continue upon, what is nature for any man to begin upon? <hi>Peter</hi> had received grace, and he made an honeſt reall profeſſion to Chriſt, not a flattering verball complement, when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Not onely they who goe out in the ſtrength of nature, but they alſo who goe out in the ſtrength of inherent grace, may quickly (notwithſtanding a ſincerity of profeſſion) diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their profeſſion, and fall from their owne ſtedfaſtneſſe: Therefore truſt in the Lord, and yee ſhall not onely hold on, but grow ſtronger and ſtronger in your way.</p>
                  <p>And if ſuch be the ſtate of a godly man, that he holds on, and waxeth ſtronger in times of trouble, what ſhall wee ſay of them, who turne out of the way, or languiſh in it, when nothing troubles them? What ſhall we ſay of them who run out of the way, though there be no Lyon in the way, when we heare that Saints will not out though there be a Lyon in the way? What ſhall we ſay of them that depart from God, when (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes in another place) they waſh their footſteps with Butter, and the rock powres out Oyle to them (that is, When God loadeth them with his benefits daily) when wee heare that the righteous, and hee that hath cleane hands will not out of the way, though every ſtep be up to the knees in Mire, though he be daſhed againſt the Rocks, and killed all
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:48478:249"/> the day long? Was there ever truth of grace in thoſe who finding nothing but comfort and outward bleſſings in the way, doe yet goe out of the way, grow cold and ſinke in their profeſſion? When Chriſt gives outward pleaſure to his followers, and they forſake him, may they not juſtly be ſuſpected to take pleaſure in forſaking him? And that they never tooke any pleaſure in following him, but onely followed him for their pleaſure? What would theſe doe if they were aſſaulted with ſtrong temptations or troubles, who turne aſide being freed from all ſuch temptations? What would they doe if their wayes were full of bryers and thorns, who goe back and Apoſtatize while their wayes are ſtrewed with flowers, and they tread upon Roſes? 'Tis true indeed, that the warme Sun (as wee ſay) cauſeth ſome to caſt off their Cloaks, which the cold winde moved them to keep clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer on; but, though it be a truth, that proſperity makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forſake God, yet it cannot be denyed but that adverſity is a greater temptation to deny him. A ſound heart may (poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly) give in a little in boyſtrous times, and Winterly dayes, but it is almoſt an infallible diſcovery of a rotten heart, to flinch in faire weather, or in a Summers day: As they who keep cloſe to, and hold on in the wayes of God in darke and doubtfull diſpenſations, ſhew a pure love to his wayes, ſo they who warpe and recede, under cleere and comfortable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, ſhew a pure diſlike of them.</p>

                  <p>Yet, there are three opinions about his meaning, while hee ſaith, <hi>Returne and come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some conceive, that <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds, being netled (as we ſay) and provoked with what he had ſpoken before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to renew the diſpute, and to rally themſelves with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Forces,<note place="margin">Quaſi facta te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudine una om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes concurrite. <hi>Nicet.</hi> Ad diſputatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem provocat. <hi>Sanct.</hi> Veruntamen omnes incumbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te &amp; venite quaeſo. <hi>Sept.</hi>
                     </note> for a freſh encounter, which <hi>Job</hi> perceiving, he (according to this Interpretation) dares them in theſe words, and ſends them a Challenge: As if he had ſayd, <hi>I ſee you are providing your ſelves, and conſulting for a rejoynder with me; I, doe, doe if you thinke good, returne, and come, put pour ſelves into what poſture you pleaſe, joyne your forces together, I am ready to receive your charge, and make my defence, I am not afrayd of you all; you are three, and I have not ſo much as a Second, yet I will not turne my back from you all, therefore, as for you all, doe yee returne and come now, come, when, or as ſoone as you will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>He challengeth them to a further diſpute. Returne, and come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Convertendi verbum cum quocunque alio verbo junctum, idem ſignificat quod <hi>rurſus,</hi> aut <hi>altera vice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid facere.</note> is (as the propriety of the phraſe in the Originall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porrts) <hi>come againe if you will, come a ſecond time, come a third.</hi> The word that we tranſlate <hi>Returne,</hi> when it is joyned with another Verbe (ſay Grammarians) ſignifies as much as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,</hi> or, <hi>to doe a thing the ſecond time.</hi> Take two places of Scripture for it (<hi>Joſ.</hi> 5.2.) <hi>At that time the Lord ſayd unto Joſhua, Make thee ſharpe Knives, and circumciſe againe the Children of Iſrael the ſecond time:</hi> So wee tranſlate: The Hebrew is, <hi>Returne</hi> (which is the word of the Text) <hi>and circumciſe them a ſecond time:</hi> Not that they who had been once circumciſed, muſt have a ſecond circumciſion: But for as much as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, which was firſt commanded to <hi>Abraham,</hi> had beene long diſuſed, while the people of Iſrael were moving and unſetled in the Wilderneſſe, therefore the Lord gives circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion a kinde of ſecond Inſtitution, by requiring <hi>Joſhua</hi> to reſtore it ſolemnely a ſecond time, as it was ſet up at firſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and circumciſe them; that is, renew that ancient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>The like way of ſpeaking, read (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.6.) where <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (in behalfe of the Church) pleads with God thus, <hi>Wilt thou not revive us againe?</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>Wilt thou not returne, and revive us?</hi> We tranſlate the Verbe <hi>Returne,</hi> by the Adverbe,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:48478:251"/> 
                     <hi>Againe. Will thou not revive us againe?</hi> Thou haſt given us many <hi>revives:</hi> when we were as <hi>dead men,</hi> and like carkaſſes rotting in the Grave, thou didſt revive us, wilt thou not revive us once more, and act over thoſe powerfully mercifull workes, and ſtrong ſalvations once more, or againe? So here, <hi>Returne, and come;</hi> that is, Come againe.</p>
                  <p>The words thus expounded, are an argument of <hi>Jobs</hi> mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and holy courage in maintaining his right, and ſtanding up in the defence of his owne integrity againſt all commers. As it is our duty to contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints; ſo for our owne faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others expound the words as an adviſe, not as a challenge; not as a profeſſion of his fixed purpoſe to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what his Freinds ſhould ſay in maintenance of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but onely as a deſire of their attention to what hee had yet to ſay for his. <hi>Come returne now,</hi> as if hee had thus expreſſed himſelfe, <hi>Yee are not right, let mee ſet you right, and inſtruct you better; learne of me; you have need enough to be taught, for I have not found a wiſe man among you.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> calls his Schollers about him (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.11.) <hi>Come yee Children, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto me, and I will teach you the feare of the Lord.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer gloſſe ſhewed the ſtrength and courage of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit, this the piety, and holineſſe of his ſpirit: 'Tis our duty, <hi>in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to inſtruct thoſe who oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth</hi> (2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25.)</p>

                     </note> The words are more generally taken for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to repentance, <hi>Come now, returne;</hi> Some tranſlate the word <hi>Returne</hi> in this Text, by <hi>Repent,</hi> which is the ſenſe of it in a hundred Texts of the Old Teſtament. Repentance is a turning and returning; all returning ſuppoſeth, eyther our being out of the way, or that we have gone as farr as our buſineſſe lyes in that way: The returning of repentance, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth only the former, for, every ſtep in ſin is quite out of our way; what have wee to doe in the way of ſin, but onely to come out of it, our buſineſſe lyes not there; all that we doe there muſt be undone againe, or elſe wee are undone for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>In this returning of repentance, we may conſider, firſt, the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:48478:252"/> terme from which, and ſecondly the terme to which wee are called to returne? The terme from which is twofold.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, Sinfull practices.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Falſe and erroneous opinions.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> doth not deale with his Freinds about the former; hee did about the latter; they were under a grand miſtake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Doctrine of providence, and from that he invites them to a ſpeedy returne.</p>
                  <p>The terme to which we are to returne in the actings of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is threefold.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, To our ſelves.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, To God.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, To him whom wee have wronged, or from whom we ſinfully diſſent.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> may be interpreted as calling his Freinds to a returne, in this threefold reference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ad ſe redire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Eatinis dicitur qui ad bonam mentem redit. <hi>Grot.</hi>
                     </note>Firſt, As repentance is a returning to our ſelves: a man that is carried away, either to falſe opinions, or into wicked courſes, is gone from his neereſt home: 'Tis a duty to deny our ſelves, but 'tis a ſin to depart from our ſelves: And as it is a ſin to depart from our ſelves, ſo every ſin is a departure from our ſelves; therefore repentance which is a turning from ſin, muſt needs be a returning to our ſelves. The Goſpel repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the repentance of the Prodigall Son, under this notion (<hi>Luke</hi> 15.17.) <hi>And when he came to himſelfe, he ſayd, &amp;c.</hi> He had not been with himſelfe a long time before, yet at laſt he came to himſelfe, this was his firſt ſtep to repentance. An impenitent perſon is not onely out of his way, but out of his wits; he is gone, not onely from Divine truth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but from his owne naturall reaſon and prudence; if ſo, whenſoever he repents, he returnes to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Repentance is a returning to God; <hi>If thou wilt returne O Iſrael (ſaith the Lord) returne unto me (Jer.</hi> 4.1.) The grace of repentance is moſt frequently and moſt ſuitably expreſſed by this act of returning to God; and they who doe not repent are every where ſayd not to returne to God (<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.) Yet have yee not returned unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Repentance is a returning to man: We muſt not be aſhamed to acknowledge our faylings one to another, or to returne to them in duty from whom we have departed, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:48478:252"/> by not giving them their due, or by accuſing them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duely. We muſt not be aſhamed of returning to them, by ſubmitting to the truth, from whom wee have departed by following or holding any errour. Thus <hi>Job</hi> may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved counſelling and calling his Freinds to a returne in theſe three ſenſes given: Firſt, to themſelves: Secondly, to God; Thirdly, to him, whom they had ſo long oppoſed. But though all three may be included, yet the ſcope and deſigne of <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to intend the third: <hi>Returne, and come now;</hi> that is, <hi>Returne to me,</hi> let not truth fare the worſe for my ſake, doe not you caſt it off, becauſe I hold it. It is not enough to turne from any evill, whether of opinion or practice, and returne to the obedience of God, but we muſt alſo returne to the love of good men, and unite with them in the truth.</p>
                  <p>But why muſt they returne? <hi>Job</hi> gives the reaſon expreſly in the latter part of the Verſe.</p>
                  <q>For I cannot finde one wiſe man among you.</q>
                  <p>All the wayes of ſin and errour are wayes of folly; they ſtampe a man for a <hi>Foole and unwiſe,</hi> whoſoever walkes in them; <hi>I cannot finde one wiſe man among you:</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>I cannot finde,</hi> It ſhewes that he had endeavoured to finde, he had been ſeeking for a wiſe man among them, but he found none; <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 14.2.) <hi>looked down from heaven upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek after God</hi> (but he found none) <hi>They are all gone aſide (Verſ.</hi> 3.) <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to have been upon ſuch an inquiry: He had looked over his Freinds, and weighed them one by one, but he found not one wiſe man among them. The Preacher (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.27.28.) <hi>counting one by one to finde out the account, found but one man</hi> (that is, one wiſe or good man) <hi>among a thouſand:</hi> No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile then if <hi>Job</hi> found not one among three, yet conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what three theſe were, men numbred among <hi>the Worthies,</hi> poſſibly, <hi>the firſt three</hi> of that age and place, it may juſtly be mervailed why <hi>Job</hi> ſhould ſpeak at ſo low a rate, or ſo ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them: Was he not too cenſorious and rigid, too bold and adventerous, to ſpeake thus concerning men of ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, authority, and reputation, for wiſedome, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea, and for holineſſe too, as theſe <hi>three</hi> were? Shall we ſay that this cenſure proceeded from <hi>Jobs</hi> wiſedome, or
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:48478:253"/> from his paſſion? Was he wiſe in ſaying ſo, or ſo much as charitable.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>Job</hi> did not ſpeake this from any ill will to his Freinds, or from contempt of them; it had been not onely unfreindly, but very ſinfull to have done it. That word of Chriſt had its truth in thoſe times, <hi>Hee that is angry with his brother unadviſedly, ſhall be in danger of judgement; and he that ſaith to his Brother, Racha</hi> (which ſignifies an empty fellow, or a man that hath nothing in him) <hi>ſhall be in danger of a Councell, but he that ſaith, thou Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>le, ſhall be in danger of Hell ſtre (Matth.</hi> 5.23.) <hi>Job</hi> did not call his Freinds Fooles, when he ſayd, <hi>I finde not one wiſe man among you;</hi> So much may be ſayd without paſſion or reviling: Nor did he queſtion their wiſedome in generall, but (as hath been anſwered for him upon a like paſſage) onely to the point in hand: As if he had ſayd, after all this arguing, <hi>You are ſtill beſides the matter. you have not hit the joynt of my caſe; come to mee, I will ſhew you your miſtake, and make it plaine that you are all out.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is no fault to ſpeake of men as we finde them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The rule of Chriſt (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.1.) <hi>Judge not that yee be not judged,</hi> forbids, firſt raſh judgement of men, ſecondly, wrong judgement of men, thirdly, finall judgement of men (that's peculiar to God) but it doth not forbid all judgement of men. We may call <hi>a Spade, a Spade,</hi> and him unwiſe who is ſo: All reproving is taken away, if all judging be, for wee muſt reprove no man but whom we judge faulty, <hi>Let the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oeous ſmite me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 141.5.) Hee meanes it not of ſmiting with the Sword, but of ſmiting with a deſerved cenſure, as if he had ſayd, If I have done amiſſe let me hear of it, yea let me ſmart for it, by a faithfull reproofe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A wiſe man may doe or ſpeake that which is a juſt forfeiture of his preſent reputation for wiſedome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This proceeds ſometimes from a ſpeciall judgement of God upon men, who in anger blaſts their abilities, and commands a decay upon their greateſt treaſures of wiſedome (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.14.) <hi>The wiſedome of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their prudent men ſhall be hid:</hi> It ſhall be ſo, ſaith God; the underſtanding of man is as much at Gods diſpoſe, as his
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:48478:253"/> riches or honours are. Now as this proceeds ſometimes from the ſpeciall judgement of God upon man; ſo it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at any time from the naturall frame of man, who at the beſt is a creature compoſed of light and darkneſſe, of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and folly, of knowledge and ignorance, of grace and corruption, of an old man, as well as of a new. The over act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the worſer part, may ſoone leave a good and a wiſe man (in the maine) under an ecclipſe, both of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wiſedome. <hi>David ſayd in his haſt</hi> (and as hee ſayd it, he ſinned in ſaying ſo) <hi>All men are lyars:</hi> But we may ſay it with fulleſt deliberation (and not ſin at all in ſaying ſo) that <hi>All men are lyars.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith it (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4.) while he ſaith, <hi>Yea let God be true, and every man a lyar;</hi> that is, Let this be acknowledged and confeſſed by all, That God cannot lye, ſuch is his power that hee can neyther deceive, nor be deceived; but let it be as much acknowledged that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is under a poſſibility to be deceived, yea and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the worſt ſenſe, &amp; that in ſome ſenſe every man is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually deceived, or a Deceiver: which proves this to be a truth, <hi>Every man is a lyar:</hi> The lye, is that, which no man will beare at the hand of man, yet all muſt beare it from the hand of God; it is indeed a diſhonour, but it is no ſlander to ſay, that every man is a lyar: and becauſe he is ſo, hee may ſoone diſ-intitle himſelfe of wiſedome. We muſt not lay too much upon men, for when they ſpeake and doe moſt unwiſely, they ſpeak and doe moſt like men.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.7.) ſaith, <hi>They like men have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Covenant:</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>They have tranſgreſſed like Adam.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſome, <hi>over whom death reigned, who yet had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion (Rom.</hi> 5.14.) Infants dye, and they dye in that ſin which <hi>Adam</hi> committed, though they never come to commit ſin actvally as <hi>Adam</hi> did; but all who ſin actually, ſin after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion: He ſet the firſt Copy, and all his Poſterity have written after him. Wee doe but ſhew what we are, and whence we are, when we ſin, even a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men, the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> To be a man is alſo to be a ſinner. Now, as it may be ſayd, we like men have tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo we like men are unwiſe. It is very eaſie for the wiſeſt man to doe unwiſely; wee have but ſhewed our ſelves men
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:48478:254"/> when we have ſhewed our ſelves unwiſe. That hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Axiome, <hi>It is humane for man to erre:</hi> One of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſentences among men, is, That man may doe unwiſely: He that doth all things wiſely is more like God then a Man, nor can we doe any thing wiſely, but as God is pleaſed to teach and guide us. As we have need to aske our <hi>daily bread</hi> from God for the ſupport of our bodies, ſo our daily wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from God for the management of our affaires. As God <hi>takes the wiſe in their owne craftineſſe</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19.) ſo he can take wiſedome from the crafty; and unleſſe he ſupply wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the vviſe, they will ſoone be ſo overtaken by their own folly, that of a whole throng of them, it may be ſayd, by him that engageth with them, <hi>I have not found one wiſe man among you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiſe men are rarely to be found.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſtore of ſubtle men, and crafty men there are but too many; but the wiſe man is a rare Jewel: It was for a wiſe man that the Prophet commands a ſearch to be made, when he ſayd (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>Run yee too and fro, through the ſtreets of Jeruſalem, and ſee now and know, and ſeeke in the broad places thereof, if you can finde a man: Jeruſalem</hi> was full <hi>of men,</hi> and yet <hi>a man</hi> could not be found, when diligently ſought for: What man was this? The next words deſcribe him for a wiſe man indeed, <hi>if there be any that executeth judgement, and ſeeketh the truth.</hi> I cannot ſay that ſuch wiſe men <hi>are thick ſowne,</hi> but I am very ſure, <hi>they are thinn come up. Paul</hi> found ſo great a ſcarſity and dearth of them, even among the Saints in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that though he doth not ſay it poſitively (with <hi>Job</hi> here) I have not found a wiſe man among you; yet he ſpeakes it Interrogatively, and chidingly (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.5.) <hi>I ſpeake to your ſhame, is it ſo, that there is not a wiſe man among you? No not one that ſhall be able to judge betweene his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> There are not many <hi>knowing wiſe men,</hi> among all men, <hi>but judging wiſe men</hi> are feweſt of all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiſe men are apt to ſhew themſelves unwiſe in expounding and judging the providences and dealings of God toward man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The workes of the moſt wiſe God are all right, but few men are wiſe enough to pick out the right meaning of them.
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:48478:254"/> Providence is carryed about the World in a Chariot of light, and yet there is much darkneſſe in the minds of moſt men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. This ariſes chiefely two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the ſeeming confuſions which are in the world; God doth not keep a method, nor governe himſelfe by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, no man can tell certainely which way he vvill goe, by looking into the way vvhich he hath gone; for though he uſeth no liberty in the iſſue of his dealings, but rewardeth every man according to his works, yet hee uſeth much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the meanes which lead unto it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ariſeth from the narrowneſſe of mans heart, who meaſuring God by his owne line, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what God hath done, by what he would do, cannot (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes in another caſe) attaine unto the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God in vvhat he doth.</p>
                  <p>'Tis excellent wiſedome to know how to interpret and improve the dealings of God vvith our ſelves or others. The groſſeſt miſ-interpretation of his dealings, is, to conclude the guilt or innocency of man, the love or hatred of God from them. <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds upon ſuch miſtakes, incurred this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>I have not found one wiſe man among you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having by way of introduction, ſpoken to the men, or to the perſons of his Freinds, proceeds to ſpeake his owne caſe.</p>

                  <p>But how could <hi>Job</hi> affirme, The terme, or <hi>dayes of my life are paſt,</hi> when, as, he was alive that day to ſay this, ſo, he lived many a faire day after he had ſayd it. Can we call that <hi>paſt,</hi> which is ſtill preſent with us? or which is yet to come?</p>
                  <p>He affirmes this, Firſt, becauſe he conceived that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of his dayes were actually paſt, and that it was not worth while to reckon upon the few dayes behinde, he did not thinke that remnant ſo conſiderable as to meaſure it, but threw it by, as a peice of <hi>uſeleſſe nothing:</hi> Our dayes are ſo paſſing, that (with a little Rhetorick) we may ſay they are paſt, as ſoone as they begin; how much more may wee ſay ſo, when we are ſure they muſt ſhortly end, and are really almoſt, yea, onely not, paſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> might ſay, <hi>My dayes are paſt,</hi> becauſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it had ſeized on his ſpirit, that his Glaſſe was run, that hee ſhould dye preſently, hee never looked to outlive that ſtorme: So that his <hi>dayes were paſt</hi> in his account, though not in Gods account. <hi>Job</hi> could ſay of himſelfe (as we uſe to ſay of thoſe Women, who have gone out their full time of Child-bearing) that, <hi>He had not a day more to reckon:</hi> As <hi>Job</hi> had a full aſſurance that he ſhould live eternally, ſo he had a kinde of aſſurance that hee ſhould dye very ſhortly: And therefore as to his owne apprehenſions, and the calculation which he had made of his dayes, their date was out, and hee might ſay, <hi>My dayes are paſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, As taken for the ſtate of his life, ſo <hi>My dayes are paſt,</hi> is, My good dayes, my proſperous dayes, are paſt; you tell me of a day of deliverance, what a morning I ſhall have, but I looke on all my dayes here, as dayes of darkneſſe; wee ſay of a man who is not only in an evill, but in a deſperate, or irrecoverably evill condition, <hi>He hath ſeene all his beſt dayes,</hi> or <hi>all his good dayes are gone: Job was full of truſt for a good eternity, but he had no hope of good days.</hi> The terme of a mans dayes may continue long, when the comfort of his dayes, is, or when his comfortable dayes are quite paſt: Though <hi>Jobs</hi> dayes continued, as to the terme of his life, yet his dayes (as hee judged) were paſt, as to any comfortable ſtate of life, in which ſense he might alſo ſay, <hi>My dayes are paſt.</hi>

                  <p>Nor did <hi>Job</hi> ſpeake this complainingly, or with a low ſpirit, <hi>My dayes are paſt,</hi> he did not whine it out as they doe, who are loath to dye, and would faine live ſtill in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of life; but he ſpake boldly and cheerfully, he ſpake of his Dying day, as of his Marriage day, <hi>My dayes are paſt.</hi> As a young man ſaith, <hi>My marriage day is at hand,</hi> I ſhall be marryed ſhortly; with ſuch a holy allacrity <hi>Job</hi> ſpake, I ſhall dye ſhortly, <hi>my dayes are paſt:</hi> He looked upon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable dayes in the World as paſt, and yet he was comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Job</hi> was full of paine, yet uſually in the cloſe of his ſpeeches he gathered up himſelfe, and ſpake in a height and heat of ſpirit: As the Cock towards morning flutters his Wings before he Crowes, and gives warning of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day; or as the Lyon ſtrikes his ſides with his Tayle, to rouze up his ſpirits before he attempts his prey; ſo <hi>Job</hi> ſtirr'd up himſelfe towards the cloſe of his anſwers, and reſumed new ſpirits, acting <hi>That dying man</hi> to the life, who having nothing in this World, eyther to feare or hope, dyes without feare, yet with abundance, yea in aſſurance of hope: <hi>My dayes are paſt.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>His contentments are not done, when the terme of his life is done: He can ſay, <hi>My dayes are paſt,</hi> as cheerfully, as <hi>Agag</hi> ſayd, <hi>Surely, the bitterneſſe of death is paſt. Some godly men have dyed farr more pleaſantly then ever any wicked man lived.</hi>

                  <p>Faith overlookes, or lookes thorow and beyond all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills of this life, to a good which ſhall never dye; yea Faith ſees and enjoyes a preſent good, while ſenſe ſees nothing, and indeed hath nothing elſe to ſee, but evill. A carnall man parts with his good dayes, or with the good of his dayes, as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> went to deliver up <hi>Michal, Sauls</hi> Daughter, and <hi>Davids</hi> Wife by right, weeping all along as he went (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.16.) There's a ſad parting betweene a worldly heart and worldly things; but he that is ſpiritually minded, though he doth not

                  <p>
                     <hi>My purpoſes are broken off:</hi> The Septuagint render, <hi>My heart ſtrings are broken:</hi> The heart-ſtrings by a metaphor, may be taken for purpoſes, becauſe purpoſes are as Bands or ſtrings upon the heart; and therefore when purpoſes are broken, we may ſay, the bands or ſtrings of the heart are broken.</p>
                  <p>Another reads, <hi>The bindings or faſtnings of my body are looſned, or torne aſunder;</hi> which tranſlation (as alſo the former) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken literally, notes onely his neerneſſe to death; for when a man dyeth, we ſay, his heart-ſtrings breake, and his whole body is in a fit of convulſion.</p>
                  <q>My purpoſes are broken.</q>
                  <p>The word ſignifies a violent forcible breaking, as if a Giant had broken them.</p>
                  <p>But what was it which broke his purpoſes? The violence and continuance of his afflictions was this Breaker; or his purpoſes were broken by the confuſed motions and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome repreſentations of his owne fanſie, to which ſick men are very ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Againe, what were thoſe purpoſes of his which were broken? If they were evill purpoſes, he had reaſon to rejoyce, not to complaine; if they were good purpoſes, was it not his ſin as well as his affliction that they were broken off.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer to that, Purpoſes may be good, and yet broken
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:48478:256"/> without the ſin of the purpoſer, if himſelfe be not the cauſe of that breach, and the impediment of their performance: If our holieſt purpoſes are broken off by the inevitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, the holineſſe of man receives no blemiſh by it. The purpoſes of <hi>Job</hi> were good doubtleſſe, eyther ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good, or civilly good; and they may be taken eyther for thoſe purpoſes of doing good, which hee had, before hee fell into trouble, or for thoſe which hee had layd up in his breſt, to doe, when he ſhould be againe reſtored and delivered out of trouble. As if he had ſayd, I once had an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, and I purpoſed with my ſelfe what to doe with, or in my new life, but now thoſe purpoſes are all broken off, for I ſee my life is ready to be broken off.

                  <q>Even the thoughts of my heart.</q>
                  <p>Every thought of the heart is not a purpoſe, yet every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is a thought of the heart; our thoughts are made up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to purpoſes, eyther what to doe, or not to doe: Hence it is uſuall to ſay, I thought to have done ſuch or ſuch a thing, that is, I purpoſed to doe it. Therefore <hi>Job</hi> might well ſay, <hi>My purpoſes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart,</hi> becauſe purpoſes are nothing elſe but a frame, or pack of thougts: there is an elegancie in that word which we tranſlate <hi>Thoughts.</hi>

'Tis as natural for thoughts to riſe in the heart, as it is for water to riſe in a ſpring, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt did not chide them becauſe thoughts, but becauſe ſuch thoughts did riſe in their hearts: We cannot hinder our hearts from thinking, no more then wee can hinder the fire from burning, or water from wetting; but 'tis our duty to hinder our hearts from undue or diſcourageing thoughts, and to check them for thinking ſo. Thoughts rule the heart and put it into ſeverall frames and formes according to their owne likeneſſe; and therefore it is both our wiſedome and our holineſſe to put and keepe our thoughts in the beſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

The imaginary frames which they ſet up, the contrivances, plots, and projects of their hearts are all ſwept away like the Spiders webb, or broken like the Cockatrices Egge, when themſelves are ſwept away from the face of the Earth, and broken by the power of death. The thoughts of many Princes and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians dye while themſelves live: <hi>Achitophels</hi> purpoſes were broken and diſappointed, while himſelfe looked on, and he was ſo vexed to ſee it, that hee executed himſelfe becauſe his
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:48478:258"/> purpoſes were not executed. In theſe times of publick ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, how many purpoſes have we ſeen goe to wrack: They who have been long laying their deſignes, and brooding upon their counſels have had their egs broken in a moment, &amp; their thoughts blown away like Chaffe before the wind, or the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt duſt before the whirlwind: Now as the purpoſes of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout gathering riches, about taking their pleaſure, about ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing themſelves to, or eſtabliſhing themſelves in honor and high places, have periſhed before they dyed; ſo when ſuch dye, all their purpoſes ſhall certainly periſh: And as the purpoſes of all about worldly things periſh in the approaches of death; ſo doe the purpoſes of ſome about ſpirituall and heavenly things. How many have had purpoſes to repent, to amend their lives and turne to God, which have been prevented, and totally broken off, by the extremity of paine and ſickneſſe, but chiefly by the ſtroake of death; when they have (as they thought) <hi>been about to repent, and</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>turne over a new leafe in their lives;</hi> they have been turned into the Grave by death, and into Hell by the juſt wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>Some interpret this Text, as <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint of the unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of his thoughts about heavenly things, and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his purpoſes in the purſuit of eternity: He could not make his thoughts about Heaven hold or hange together, even thoſe thoughts were full of gaps and empty ſpaces, or rather like Ropes of Sand. Many honeſt and gracious ſoules have found worke enough upon a death-bed, or a ſick-bed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the paine and infirmity of their bodyes.

                  <p>Seeing not onely our worldly thoughts periſh, but our ſpirituall thoughts may be much broken by ſtrong tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and variety of bodily diſtempers, in times of trouble and ſickneſſe, let us haſten to ſettle our purpoſes and thoughts about eternall life, yea to ſee our ſoules paſſed from death to life, before we ſee ſickneſſe and ſorrow, much more before we ſee our ſelves ready to paſſe from life to death. Purpoſes to repent, or to minde heavenly things, not onely may, but for the moſt part are broken off, and loſt when ſickneſſe and ſorrow finde us. Beware of this deceit of the Devill, who tells us we ſhall have leaſure to ſeek God when wee are ſick, and that we ſhall have a faire opportunity to ſettle all the affaires of our ſouls, when we are going out of the body: then (he tels us) we ſhall have nothing elſe to doe, and therefore we ſhall ſurely do it then. Let not Satan deceive us with theſe vaine words, for then he intends us moſt blowes, then is his ſeaſon to breake our thoughts into a thouſand peices, and to vex us with the ſplinters, even when we lye upon our ſicke beds, or are bewildred with affliction. There is ſcarſe one of twenty, but findes breakings, and convulſions upon his thoughts, at the ſame time when he feeles them upon his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: How often have ſick men been heard to ſay, We cannot ſet our ſelves to think ſeriouſly of Heaven, or to act Faith, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>But a metaphoricall change of night into day, and of day into night, hath been often made; for when the night is ſo full of trouble to us that we cannot ſleep, the night is changed

                     </note> nor take our comforts, then the day is changed into night: The night is the time appointed for naturall reſt, therefore the night may be ſayd to be changed into day, when we cannot reſt, and this is a great affliction; for though in ſome ſenſe, and in Scripture ſenſe too, to have the night changed into day, is a mercy, and notes a change from a troubled eſtate into a comfortable eſtate, yet to have the night changed by our reſtleſneſſe, or want of ſleep, is both an affliction it ſelfe, and an argument that we are burdned and over-preſſed with other manifold afflictions.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe <hi>Job</hi> complaines of the change of his night into day; and thus God often changeth times and ſeaſons, both to particular perſons and whole Nations (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21.) <hi>Daniel anſwered and ſayd, Bleſſed be the Name of God for ever and ever, for wiſedome and might are his, and hee changeth the times, and the ſeaſons, hee removeth Kings, and hee ſets up Kings:</hi> He changeth the times and ſeaſons; that is, He makes ſeaſons comfortable, or troubleſome, peaceable, or unquiet, hee changeth the night into day, or the day into night, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe pleaſeth.</p>

Our metaphoricall dayes are long or ſhort, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſtance which the darkneſſe of trouble keepes from them. Thus the change of day into night, and of night into day, is to be reckoned by the condition we are in: When we cannot ſleep in the night, our night is changed into day, and when ſorrow ſeazeth on us in the day, our day is changed into night, or, <hi>The light is ſhort to us by reaſon of darkneſſe.</hi>

                  <p>We beleeve the truth of the promiſe; we hope for the good layd up in the promiſe; we waite till that good be given out unto us. <hi>If I waite</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) God waites upon us, and we waite upon God; God waits in mercy, we waite in duty, <hi>God waites to be gracious (Iſa.</hi> 30.18.) and man waits to be refreſhed with the grace of God. <hi>Job,</hi> in this place, ſeemes to make light or little of this duty of waiting: <hi>If I waite,</hi> or <hi>although I waite,</hi> or <hi>what if I waite,</hi> what ſhall I get by it? Where's the profit? Or what are my commings in? He tells
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:48478:263"/> us what; If I waite, all that I ſhall get by it will be <hi>a Grave,</hi> or <hi>a bed in darkneſſe:</hi> And all my preferment will be <hi>to call corruption my Father, and to ſay of the Worme, Thou art my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my Siſter:</hi> Here's all I am like to have for all my waiting.</p>
                  <p>But was this all he looked for by waiting?</p>
                  <p>Yes, it was all he looked for, and all he thought himſelfe in a capacity to receive in this World (though in that hee was deceived) hee had no expectation but to dye, and goe downe to the duſt; he had no hope to rejoyce in any kindred or alliance, but wormes and corruption, theſe were his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Siſters and Brethren: If I wait here's all I ſhall have. Thus (as I intimated before) the words carry a ſtrong confutation of thoſe hopes which his Freinds endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to raiſe up in him, that God would raiſe him up,<note place="margin">Docet praeciſam eſſe ſibi his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis omnem vitae ſpem vel ſi eam maximè animo fovere velit. <hi>Si expectem, i. e.</hi> ſi expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſtudeam, <hi>Merl.</hi>

No, ſaith hee, what doe you tell mee of a great Houſe, and of a great Name, of a riſing Sun, and of the morning light, why am I ſo often told of theſe things, I tell you once for all, the Grave is my houſe, darkneſſe is my bed, and the wormes are my kindred and companions; let me heare no more of theſe groundleſſe prophecyings, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory flatteries, for my wound is incurable, and I am at the laſt caſt, <hi>If I waite, the Grave is my houſe.</hi>

                  <p>The light of the body is the eye, and the light of the ayre is the Sun; but in the Grave the Sun ſhines not, or if it did, yet there the eye ſees not, therefore the Grave is darkneſſe: <hi>I have made my bed in the darkneſſe:</hi> And darkneſſe is moſt fit for a bed, ſleepe loves darkneſſe: A working Roome muſt be light, but 'tis no matter how darke a ſleeping Roome be: when we goe to ſleep, if it be not darke, we make it darke, that ſo we may ſleep the better. The Apoſtle gives that as an argument why the Saints ſhould not ſleep as doe others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were once darkneſſe, but now light in the Lord. He that is in aeriall light can hardly get his body to ſleep, and will you who are in ſpirituall light compoſe your ſoules to ſleep?

                  <p>It may be queſtioned (towards the clearing of this Verſe) Did not <hi>Job</hi> waite? Why doth he ſay, <hi>If I waite?</hi> Was hee upon Iffs or Ands about that great and neceſſary duty? Hee reſolved peremptorily (<hi>Chap.</hi> 14.14.) <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time will I waite till my change come:</hi> And is hee ſo much changed already into an unreſolvedneſſe about his wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</p>
                  <pb n="517" facs="tcp:48478:264"/>
                  <p>I anſwer, This ſuppoſition about waiting, is not a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor is it a note of his irreſolution to waite for any thing, but only for that particular, about which his Freinds were ſo buſie to awaken and heighten his expectations. <hi>Job</hi> waited upon God for all things which he deſired to have, onely he did not waite upon God for that which the viſible diſpenſations of God ſeemed to tell him aloud, that he ſhould not have, a temporall deliverance; yea, when he ſaith, <hi>If I waite,</hi> namely, for this thing, it is an Argument that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it a duty to waite upon God for all thoſe things, for the receiving of which he had any rule or ground of hope from God: Every exception confirmes the rule. Hee that ſaith he doth not wait upon God about that for which hee hath no warrant, ſaith ſtrongly, that he ought to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God where he hath a warrant.</p>
                  <p>From which conſequence we may Obſerve this unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is the duty of man to waite upon God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Waiting upon God is a duty of the firſt Commandement; it is a part of naturall worſhip: It is not in mans liberty whether he will waite or no, hee is commanded to waite: <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks it double, and no doubt he laboured to act it double (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.1.) <hi>Waiting, I waited,</hi> or <hi>I waited patiently upon God:</hi> The Apoſtle gives that advice to the Saints (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36.) <hi>Yee have need of patience, that after yee have done the will of God, yee may receive the promiſe:</hi> There is doing the will of God, and then there is receiving the promiſe; yet we muſt doe ſomewhat after we have done the will of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can receive the promiſe; and that is, we muſt waite upon him: <hi>You have need of patience,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; What kinde of patience? There are three ſorts of patience.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The patience of labouring, that he puts in the former part of the Verſe, it is our <hi>doing the will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is the patience of ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is the patience of waiting after we have both done and ſuffered the will of God.</p>
                  <p>We have need of this patience, <hi>the patience of waiting,</hi> that we may receive the promiſe, that is, the mercy promiſed; God hath preventing mercies, and they come to us before we wait for them; but his rewarding mercies muſt be waited for: he
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:48478:265"/> will exerciſe the grace of patience in us, by cauſing us to wait for our reward, as he exerciſeth the graces of love and zeale, in commanding us to doe his will; and uſually without waiting after we have done his will, there is no receiving of the reward for doing his will. And for the promiſes and Propheſies in generall, <hi>though God never faile his owne time, yet he ſeldome comes at ours:</hi> That great promiſe about the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the people of Iſrael out of Aegypt, was performed punctually to an houre (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41, 42.) <hi>It came to paſſe at the end of foure hundred and thirty yeares, even that very night, it came to paſſe, that God brought out all the Hoſt of Iſrael.</hi> The time being out in the night, God did not ſtay till morning, but brought them out that very night: We count it a very veniall ſin to breake our word for a day, or to let a man waite a day beyond the time promiſed; we commonly ſay, <hi>A day breakes no ſquare:</hi> It is not ſo with God, he keeps his time punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, he will not break his word one day. Wee read of the ſhortning of evill times, but not of their lengthening, God never makes his people waite for good longer then hee hath promiſed. But though God keep his time exactly, and come juſt at the moment he hath prefixed and foreſhewed, yet we are apt to antedate the promiſe of God, and to ſet it a time before Gods time: We are ſhort ſighted and ſhort breathed; that which is but a moment in the Kalendar of Heaven, ſeemes more then an age to us. Now in this regard there is much need of patience, of waiting patience, to tarry, not onely our time, but Gods time; which is the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk (Chap.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>The viſion is for an appointed time, but at the end it will ſpeake and not lye, though it tarry, waite for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, and will not tarry:</hi> The Prophet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, <hi>Though it tarry, waite for it;</hi> there's our duty, yet hee preſently affirmes, <hi>It will not tarry:</hi> So then it may tarry, and yet it tarryeth not; it may tarry beyond our time, but it tarryeth not beyond Gods time; <hi>It will come, and will not tarry;</hi> that is, not beyond the time which God hath prefixed, though it may ſoone tarry beyond the time which we have prefixed; therefore if it tarry, waite; there is no remedy but patience.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> gives the rule (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4.) <hi>Let patience have her perfect worke:</hi> that is, Let all manner of patience
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:48478:265"/> worke in you to the end, and let it worke to all thoſe ends, or purpoſes to which it is appointed. Patience hath her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect worke.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When it puts forth perfect acts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When it perſeveres in acting.</p>
                  <p>Patience aſcends by three ſteps to the perfection of her worke.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is a ſilent (not a ſullen) ſubmiſſion or reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves to the diſpoſe of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9.) <hi>I was dumb</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, A kinde of thankfull acceptation, or kiſſing of the Rod which ſmites us: <hi>If their uncircumciſed hearts be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41.) <hi>and they accept the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their iniquity:</hi> The phraſe imports a welcome recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, as of a love-token from the hand of a Freind, or that the Rod is not onely juſtly, but mercifully and graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflicted: This a great perfection of patience, and to this <hi>Jobs</hi> patience attained the very firſt day of his ſorrows, while he bleſſed the Name of the Lord, not onely for giving him ſo many good things, but alſo for taking them away (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.21.)</p>
                  <p>The third ſtep, is ſpirituall joy, and ſerious cheerfulneſſe under ſorrowfull diſpenſations: This the Apoſtle exhorts the Brethren to (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 2.) <hi>Count it all joy when yee fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe temptations:</hi> And preſently adds (intimating that the higheſt perfection of patience conſiſts in this joy) <hi>Let patience have her perfect worke:</hi> As if hee had ſayd, I have told you what the perfect worke of patience is, doe not give check to your patience till it be got up this ſtep, and hath ſet your ſoules, <hi>a rejoycing,</hi> or (as we ſpeake) <hi>a crowing</hi> over all your temptations.</p>
                  <p>Every grace ſhould have its perfect worke in us, and ſo they have, when patience hath its perfect worke; and then patience hath done that perfect work there commanded, when we waite quietly, thankfully, and rejoycingly, till God hath done the worke which he hath promiſed. This waiting pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is alſo called (by Chriſt himſelfe) <hi>The poſſeſſion of the ſoule (Luke</hi> 21.19.) <hi>Poſſeſſe yee your ſoules in patience.</hi> What title ſoever we have to our owne ſoules, we have no poſſeſſion of them without patience: As Faith gives us the poſſeſſion of
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:48478:266"/> Chriſt, ſo patience gives us the poſſeſſion of our ſelves: An impatient man is not in his owne hands; and as waiting patience gives us the preſent poſſeſſion of our ſelves, ſo it will bring us to the poſſeſſion of all good things elſe that we ſtand in need of to make us happy. The Prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth them bleſſed, who waite every bleſſing is a good thing, but to be bleſſed is all good things, <hi>not onely is a bleſſing but bleſſedneſſe the reward of a waiter. The Lord is a God of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bleſſed are all they that waite for him (Iſa.</hi> 30.18.) Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is not onely a duty, but a benefit, yea our bleſſedneſſe. And if any object, How is it bleſſedneſſe, or ſo much as a ſingle bleſſing to waite upon God under this notion as a God of judgement? To have ſayd, <hi>God is a God of mercy, bleſſed are they that waite for him,</hi> might have taken upon the heart; but to ſay, <hi>God is a God of judgement, bleſſed are they that waite for him:</hi> How can that be? Is there any deſireableneſſe in judgement?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Judgement is not there oppoſed to mercy (there's no bleſſedneſſe in being neer ſuch judgement.) We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider judgement in a threefold oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Judgement is oppoſed to anger and ſeverity (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24.) <hi>Correct me, O Lord, in judgement, not in thine anger:</hi> It is a bleſſed thing to wait upon a God of judgement, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to anger, or as judgement imports the golden Bridle of moderation upon the paſſions and affections.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Judgement is oppoſed to injuſtice, it is a bleſſed thing to waite upon a juſt God, who will certainely doe us right; it is a miſery, one of the greateſt miſeries under the Sun, to waite upon unjuſt and unrighteous men; but how great a mercy is it to waite upon a juſt, and a righteous God?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Judgement is oppoſed to folly, ignorance, and unadviſedneſſe; thus God is a God of judgement, or wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and bleſſed are they that waite upon the wiſe; it is a vexation to waite upon raſh, fooliſh, heady men, who doe they care not what, or know not what they doe; but to wait upon a man, much more upon the God of judgement, who knowes how to order and doe all things, who hath the full compaſſe of every cauſe within him, and will time every circumſtance to our beſt advantage (to waite upon this God I ſay) is a high p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Church having borne thoſes reproaches long, ſees God comming at laſt, and then ſhee breakes forth in tryumph, as if ſhee had held God forth in her hand, and cryes him up, <hi>Loe this is our God, wee have waited for him:</hi> The words have a ſound of victory, yea of many victories in them. They ſhall in the end overcome all difficulties, who can but overcome their owne hearts to a patient waiting upon God: As true repentance for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill we have done, ſo holy patience for the good we would receive, ſhall never be repented of.</p>
                  <p>And (to add that further) though, when (as it appeared here to <hi>Job</hi>) God in his providentiall actings, determines negatively, and ſpeakes it out by the manner of his workings, that his will is not to give, or doe for us ſuch a thing, it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be a duty to waite for it, yet to lay downe the duty of waiting, or to throw it up at any time upon ſuch grounds as theſe foure (which are the uſuall grounds upon which it is layd downe or throwne up) is extreamly ſinfull, and a high contempt of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is extreamly ſinfull to give over waiting upon God, as being unwilling to tarry his leiſure. 'Tis the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of God, to date all times, as much as to doe all things for us; our times are in his hand as well as our affaires, and he is the diſpoſer of all things, as in regard of the means, ſo alſo of their ſeaſons. Hence 'tis our duty to waite as a time, ſo all the dayes of our appointed time (how many ſoever they are, they are all of Gods appointment) till our change ſhall come, as <hi>Job</hi> profeſſed his reſolution to doe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 14.14.) The Iſraelites are charged (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.41.) <hi>For limitting the holy one of Iſrael:</hi> How did they limit him? There is a twofold limitting of God: Firſt, to meanes, when
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:48478:267"/> we thinke we cannot be ſaved unleſſe we are ſaved our owne way. Secondly, there is a limitting of God to times, he muſt ſave us by ſuch a day, or elſe we cannot be ſaved: Thus the Iſraelites limitted the Holy one of Iſrael, and ſet bounds to him, whoſe power and wiſedome are immeaſurable. God may juſtly limit man, and man never doth juſtly till hee keeps within the limits of God; but it is not a ſin but a high preſumption, for man to limit God: nor is it poſſible for man to breake his owne bounds more by any thing he doth, then by ſetting bounds to God, what, or when he ſhall doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is exceeding ſinfull to give over waiting on God for deliverance out of an affliction, becauſe we are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpleaſed with God who ſends it, or are angry at the affliction ſent. When God throwes a ſtone at us, wee ſhould ſtoop humbly, and taking it up, put it into our boſome (if we doe ſo, though it looke like a worthleſſe Peble, it will quickly change into a precious Pearle, however wee muſt) not like the Dogg rage at it and bite it, which yet many doe. Now they who are vexed at the affliction which God ſends, or at God himſelfe, for ſending the affliction, theſe will never waite upon God for the removing of it. Such was the frame of that wretched King (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33.) who ſayd, <hi>This evill is of the Lord, wherefore ſhould I waite on the Lord any longer?</hi> As if he had ſayd, I will never waite for any kindneſſe at his hand, who hath already uſed me thus unkindly: Hee that takes an affliction in ill part at the hand of God, will never expect good from him; or if he doe, it muſt come very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, or elſe his waiting is over. 'Tis not unlikely that this King, by the advice of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> had waited a little, but he was ſoone weary; <hi>Why ſhould I waite any longer?</hi> There was reaſon enough why he ſhould, but his unbeleife would not let him ſee what he ſaw, nor underſtand what himſelfe had ſpoken: For the reaſon which he gave, why hee would waite no longer, is the ſtrongeſt reaſon that can be given why he ſhould have waited longer, <hi>This evill is of the Lord.</hi> 'Tis true, that among men, they, from or of whom evils are, are uſually the unfitteſt to remove them: Men who wound are ſeldome skil'd at curing; but the Lord brings no evill, but what he can remove, nor doth he make any wound but what he can heale; yea no power nor art in the World, can heale
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:48478:267"/> the wounds that he makes, or remove the evills which hee brings, but his owne. Hence the patient Beleever cryes out with the Church (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1.) Let us returne to the Lord, yea let us waite upon the Lord, <hi>for hee hath torne and hee will heale:</hi> But the impatient unbeleever ſaith, Let us turne away from the Lord, let us waite upon the Lord no longer, for 'tis he that hath torne us, therefore ſurely hee will not heale us. Grace and corruption may take up the ſame principles, but they draw concluſions from them as contrary, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is exceeding ſinfull to give over waiting, as thinking that God cannot helpe. Some ſhorten their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by ſhortning the hand of God. That ſuch were the apprehenſions of the Jewes, is more then probable by the Prophets Negative aſſertion (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1.) <hi>Behold the Lords hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is exceeding ſinfull to give over waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, by turning aſide to ſinfull wayes: Some finde out (as they ſuppoſe) neerer wayes to helpe themſelves, then by attending upon God; they like not (as ſuch have prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called them) thoſe <hi>pious delayes:</hi> and ſo over Hedge and Ditch they will, to the overtaking of their owne ends. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> deſcribes ſuch (<hi>Chap.</hi> 18.12.) <hi>And they ſayd, there is no hope;</hi> or, our caſe is deſperate, all's loſt. What then? <hi>but we will walke after our owne deviſes, and every one doe after the imagination of his evill heart:</hi> The Lord had told them (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 11.) <hi>Behold I frame evill againſt you, and deviſe a device againſt you.</hi> But did the Lord deviſe a device, meerely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare them, or did he frame evill againſt them onely to undoe them? No, his ayme was their repentance, not their ruine, and therefore he adds in the ſame Verſe, <hi>Returne yee now every one from his evill wayes, and make your wayes and your doings good:</hi> As if the Lord had ſayd, Though I am about to frame evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, yet doe yee returne to me and all ſhall be well. How doe they reſent this threatning and this Counſell? They grow deſperate upon it: And ſeeing God had brought them into ſuch ſtraits, they would get out as well as they could: And as he was deviſing devices againſt them, ſo they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of their owne, and them they would follow. Thus they would not waite upon God for a remedy in the way of
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:48478:268"/> repentance for their old ſins, but they would provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a remedy by running into new ſins: They had a device in their heads, which ſhould match the device of God.</p>
                  <p>Now what the Prophet ſubjoynes (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 13, 14, 15.) as a ſtrong redargution of that people who refuſed to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in that way, the ſame may we ſay to all thoſe who refuſe to waite upon God in any way. <hi>The Virgin of Iſrael</hi> (he cals her ſo to minde her what ſhee ſhould be, not to commend her for what ſhee was) <hi>hath done a very horrible thing, will a man leave the Snow of Lebanon, which commeth from the rock of the feild?</hi> Or, will a man (as our Margin hath it) <hi>leave my feilds for a rock, or for the Snow of Lebanon?</hi> that is, Will any tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller be ſo fooliſh, as to leave the plaine feilds, where hee may paſſe with eaſe and pleaſure, without let or hinderance to climbe over craggy Rocks and precipitious Hils? will hee leave a beaten path, to goe through vaſt Woods and deſolate Forreſts covered with Snow, where no track or footſteps are to be ſeene? or (as it followes in that Verſe) <hi>ſhall the cold flowing waters which come from another place be forſaken:</hi> or, <hi>ſhall the coole running waters be forſaken for ſtrange waters:</hi> that is, Will any man who hath freſh Fountaine-water of his owne at home, goe to ſeeke water in a ſtincking Ditch, in ſtanding pooles, and miery puddles when he is a thirſt? Such is the choice or exchange which they make, who ceaſe waiting upon God in his wayes, and turne aſide for helpe to their owne <hi>crooked wayes, Stumbling</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeakes at the fifteenth Verſe of the ſame Chapter) <hi>in their wayes from the ancient paths, to walke in paths, in a way not caſt up,</hi> or, <hi>where no Cauſey is.</hi> Though the hand or providence of God doth ſometimes bring his people (as the Prophet ſpeakes (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.16.) <hi>By a way which they knew not, and leads them in paths that they have not knowne:</hi> that is, Into a way which they knew not, by any former teachings of men, or experiences of their owne; yet his hand never leads them into any way, which is not caſt up, or which may not be made out, by ſome rule or example in the word: To leave waiting upon God in his ordinary wayes, and to goe in any extraordinary way which hath no ground in the word, is purely to follow our owne wayes, and to goe after the imaginations of our evill hearts.</p>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:48478:268"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> in this place apprehended it unſeaſonable for him to waite for thoſe worldly attainments and enjoyments which his Freinds promiſed him; but he was not unwilling to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Lords leiſure, nor was he diſpleaſed with God for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting him, nor did he ſay, God could not helpe him, much leſſe did he turne from God to any wicked way to helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when he ſayd, <hi>If I wait, the Grave is mine houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A good man may give up all his worldly expectations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Beleever may in this ſenſe be an unbeleever, and lay down all his hopes in this life, of long life and of good dayes, of riches and temporall greatneſſe: When Freinds bid ſuch on their ſick beds, <hi>Be of good cheere, we hope to ſee you abroad ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we hope God will raiſe you up againe, they will even forbid thoſe comforts, and ſay, Doe not intice us back into the World with theſe hopes, the Graves are ready for us, and we have made our bed in the darkneſſe; it is not for us to looke for life here, indeed to live to us is Chriſt, but to dye is gaine.</hi> A Beleever can willingly part with all his earthly poſſeſſions for heavenly hopes, much more can he joyfully part with all his earthly hopes for the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly from theſe expreſſions, <hi>The Grave is my houſe, I have made my bed in the darkneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Beleever looks upon death as a ſtate of reſt,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the whole houſe is a place of reſt compared with the World abroad, ſo the Bed is the ſpeciall place of reſt (<hi>Revel.</hi> 14.14.) <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which dye in the Lord, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, they reſt from their labours, and their workes follow them:</hi> They ſhall follow their worke no more, who are followed by their works. The Grave is the houſe and bed of the body to all who dye: Heaven is the houſe and reſt of the ſoule to all thoſe why dye in the Lord. Saints have here a reſt in their labours, they ſhall hereafter have a reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whereas the bed of death is made in darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is nothing deſireable in death, as conſidered in it ſelfe.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall not here ſtay upon any anxious diſquiſition about the propriety of theſe relations, how <hi>Job</hi> cals corruption his Father, and the vvorme his Mother and Siſter, or in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out compariſons about them; vve are to looke onely to a generall proportion, not to an exact propriety in theſe words; there's no need to make out parallels between cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and a Father, or betweene wormes and a Mother, or a Siſter.</p>
                  <p>Onely thus much may be aſſerted particularly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſpeakes thus to ſhew that he looked on death, not onely not as an enemy, but not as a ſtranger. Death and he were well acquainted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſpeakes thus to ſhew, that death vvas not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not a ſtranger to him, but as one of his kindred: He vvas upon as fayre termes vvith death, as vvith Father and Mother.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes thus to ſhew,<note place="margin">

                     </note> that he did not onely looke upon death as in a neere relation to him, but as having a kinde of delight and contentment in death: vvhat is more ſweet to a man vvho hath been in a long journey, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, then to thinke that he is comming to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, to his Brethren and Siſters? As nature gives us kindred by blood, ſo it is a cuſtome to adopt and ſtampe to our ſelves kindred by kindneſſe; one vve call Father, and another vve call Mother; one is our Brother, a ſecond is our Siſter, a third our Cozen, by the mutuall tyes or by the receits and returnes of curteſie. Thus we are to take theſe compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as intimating vvith vvhat ſpirit <hi>Job</hi> entertained the thoughts of death, even with no other then if he had beene to fall into the embraces of Father, and Mother, and Siſter: He ſayd to corruption, as we ſhould ſay to wiſedome (<hi>Prov.</hi> 7.4.) <hi>Say unto wiſedome, thou art my Siſter, and call underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thy Kinſwoman:</hi> that is, Acquaint thy ſelfe with, and be familiar vvith vviſedome, ſo ſhalt thou keepe thy ſelfe (vvhich is both thy vviſedome and thy happineſſe) a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>From the ſtrange Woman (Verſ.</hi> 5.)</p>
                  <p>Further, it may yet be enquired, what it is which <hi>Job</hi> cals <hi>Corruption and the worme, I have ſayd to corruption, &amp;c.</hi> What is this corruption? There are two opinions about it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some interpret him ſpeaking to the corruption, and wormes which had already ſeized upon his body; for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:48478:270"/> and ulcerous ſores had bred corruption and wormes: As if he had ſayd, <hi>I may well call corruption my Father, for I am already full of corruption, I may well call the worme my Mother, my ſiſter, for the wormes creep in and out at my ſores continually: my body is as if it had layne already in the Grave, full of corruption and wormes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others expound him ſpeaking to, and of, the corruption, and wormes which waited his comming into the Grave. The vvord in the Text which wee tranſlate <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> ſignifies alſo the Grave; becauſe bodies doe not onely corrupt in the Grave,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And beſides thoſe wormes which are generated out of the putrefaction of mans body, there are vvormes ready genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Grave to entertaine us; wormes are the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Grave; there they keep houſe as Father and Mother, and Siſter, to vvelcome and embrace ſuch as deſcend into it.</p>

                  <p>Other Texts in the former paſſages of this Book, have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned like Obſervations; yet as often as this occaſion is renewed it will not be unprofitable to renew this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: To vvrite the ſame things vvhere wee read the ſame things (yet the Reader will not finde them the ſame) is not unprofitable.</p>
                  <p>I ſay ſome Beleevers are familiar vvith death, I am farre from ſaying that he vvho is not, is no Beleever: There are not in all, the ſame degrees of holineſſe, though holineſſe be the ſame in all; but a Beleever may arrive at ſuch a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſpirit, at ſuch a ſtature of holineſſe, as not to feare death. There are ſome Beleevers (and it is their ſin) who are but little acquainted vvith death, they ſeldome goe out to the Grave, or look into the pit they are going to; he that hath often converſed with death in the meditation (vvhich is a Beleevers vvay) of the death of Chriſt, cannot be affrayd to dye if he know what that death of Chriſt meanes vvhich he hath meditated upon. He that knowes it throughly, may (as the Prophet ſpeakes in another caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.8.) <hi>play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hole of this Aſpe, and put his hand upon the den of this Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice;</hi> yea, ſuch a Beleever may not onely play and put his hand upon the Grave, which is the hole of this Aſpe, and the den of this Cockatrice, but he can play with the Aſpe it ſelfe, and take up the Cockatrice in his hand; with this Aſpe or Cockatrice he can ſport himſelfe as with a Brother or a Siſter.</p>
                  <p>O how different are the thoughts of carnall men, and their vvords of death? How dreadfully doe they ſpeake and think of the Grave? An Unbeleever ſaith of the Grave, <hi>It is a priſon, not a houſe; he findes no bed in darkneſſe, 'tis to him a Dungeon, he ſaith to corruption, Thou art my foe, and to the wormes, yee are to me as Feinds and Furies:</hi> Hee cannot beare the thought of them, much leſſe their ſight and preſence. Saints ſpeak cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly of death; there is a kinde of holy courtſhip in the language of <hi>Job: Agag</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32.) <hi>came out to Samuel delicately;</hi> for ſayd he, <hi>Surely the bitterneſſe of death is paſt:</hi> but he was deceived, for <hi>Samuel</hi> hewed him in peices; and when he ſayd, the bitterneſſe of death is paſt, hee meant death was
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:48478:271"/> paſt. Hee did not beleeve, but that death would be bitter when ever it ſhould come; but he thought death was paſt for that time how ever, and ſo he came out delicately, hee ſtood as a Courtier, yea as a King before <hi>Samuel,</hi> becauſe he had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped (as he ſuppoſed) that King of terrours. Thus the Saints come out delicately indeed, and court it, in the very face of the King of terrours, for they know the bitterneſſe of death is paſt, though they were aſſured they muſt dye preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: They doe not ſay, <hi>Death is paſt,</hi> they know death will come, and they muſt dye, but the bitterneſſe is paſt, the Gall and Worme wood is taken out; and upon this account they can ſay <hi>to corruption, Thou art my Father, and to the Worme, Thou art my Mother, and Siſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corruption and wormes are the portion and companions of the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Onely Jeſus Chriſt was exempt from this portion, who though he ſubmitted himſelfe to death for ſinners, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ſin himſelfe, he was not at all ſubject to death, nor was it <hi>poſſible that hee ſhould be holden of it:</hi> hee was the holy one, he had no corruption in his ſpirit, and therefore <hi>his fleſh ſaw no corruption (Acts</hi> 2.31.) But as for all fleſh, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving corrupted all their wayes, their fleſh ſhall ſee corruption in the end.</p>
                  <p>Take two Corolaries from this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Let no man glory in bodily beauty, in honours, or alliances.</hi> Corruption will ſhortly ſeaze upon the moſt beautifull body, wormes will crawle upon the ſmootheſt cheeks, upon the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt face, and into that mouth which now boaſteth great things, and ſpeakes ſo proudly; this earth muſt turne to earth, and then the greateſt kindreds, and nobleſt Pedigrees, will be loſt or ſwallowed up in this, <hi>Corruption is my Father, and the worme my Mother, and my Siſter:</hi> Man is corruptible, while he lives, and when hee dyes he is corruption. Every man living is but a worme; Jeſus Chriſt who abaſed himſelfe to the loweſt condition of man, ſaith, <hi>I am a worme and no man (Pſal.</hi> 22 6) When man dyes, as he goes to the wormes, ſo he makes wormes; who would be proud of his fleſh, did he know that 'tis but corruption and wormes once removed, and that it muſt ſuddenly move back againe to corruption and wormes,</p>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:48478:271"/>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Seeing death hath nothing of its owne but darkneſſe, corruption, and wormes, which are all unpleaſing and a regret to fleſh and blood, therefore live much in Chriſt, who onely gives a remedy againſt all theſe evills:</hi> If we live in the Grave of Chriſt, that will make the darkneſſe of our Grave light, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ſweet unto us. He that upon good intereſt can ſay to Chriſt, <hi>Thou art my Father, thou art my Brother, thou art my All,</hi> can ſay rejoycingly to corruption, <hi>Thou art my Father, and to the worme, thou art my Mother, and Siſter. Relation to Chriſt is ſo comfortable, that it overcomes the diſcomfort of our moſt unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant relations.</hi> That which raiſed the ſpirit of holy <hi>Job</hi> to theſe free complyances with death, was the light which hee had (even in thoſe darker times) about the Redeemer, of which as the nineteenth Chapter gives us a cleare and an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious proofe; ſo the next Verſe gives us more then an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>He that cheerfully queſtions, Where is my hope? puts it almoſt out of queſtion, where his hope is.</p>
                  <q>[Where is now my hope?]</q>
                  <p>Had <hi>Job</hi> loſt his hope, or was it to ſeeke? <hi>Davids</hi> enemies interrogate him (and that interrogatory was as a Sword in his bones, or as a Dagger at his heart) <hi>Where is now thy God? (Pſal.</hi> 42.10.) their meaning was, Thy God is no where, he is not to be found, thou haſt none to helpe, none to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee: <hi>Job</hi> puts the queſtion himſelfe, and hee puts it to himſelfe, <hi>Where is now my hope?</hi> His meaning is not, that it was no where, but that it was not there where ſome would have it.</p>
                  <p>Hope may be conſidered two wayes, eyther as taken for a grace acting in us, or as taken for ſome good upon which that grace acts: <hi>Jobs</hi> queſtion concernes not hope as it is a grace acting in us; he that hath that hope knowes where it is, and where it is once it abides forever; <hi>Hope is no remover,</hi> it is an abiding grace (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13.) <hi>Now abideth faith, hope, and charity, theſe three:</hi> Theſe are abiding graces; theſe muſt and ſhall keep houſe, not onely in the Church militant in generall,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:48478:272"/> but in the ſoule of every true member of the Church: and if in reference to this hope, <hi>Job</hi> had queſtioned, <hi>Where is now my hope?</hi> He might have anſwered, It is in thy heart; the grace of hope dwels there. This grace of hope is no fading quality but a ſetled power: Hope doth not alwayes act, but it always is, where it ever was: It is not alwayes <hi>a lively hope,</hi> but it is alwayes a <hi>living hope.</hi> As <hi>Eliphaz</hi> checks <hi>Job (Chap.</hi> 4.4.) <hi>Is this thy hope:</hi> So many a Beleever deſerves to be checkt and chiden, becauſe his hope is not more ſtrong and ſtirring, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his hope is ſo unlike hope, eſpecially ſo unlike that hope, which hee ought to have, after ſo much experience. What? <hi>Is this thy hope?</hi> is this all? you have talked of hope all this while; is this all you have to ſhew for it? this is a poor peece of hope, a hope unworthy of thee. Some good men may juſtly fall under this check, and whereas hope maketh not aſhamed, they may for a time be aſhamed of their hope; yet it is with them as with thoſe Trees of which the Prophet ſpeakes (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.13.) <hi>whoſe ſubſtance is in them, when they have caſt their leaves;</hi> So the holy ſeed ſhall be, and is the ſubſtance of it; and though for a time it appeare not, and ſo may beare this queſtion, <hi>Where is it?</hi> yet it will appeare againe, and by bearing fruit, anſwer for it ſelfe, <hi>Here I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take hope for that good upon which our hope is ſet, or for the object of hope. There is a twofold object of hope.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, Eternall, and heavenly.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Temporall, and earthly.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Spirituall things are the hope layd hold upon (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18.) <hi>That by two immutable things in which it is impoſſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us:</hi> This Scripture teacheth us, that as there is a hope by which we lay hold, that's the grace of hope; ſo there is a hope upon which we lay hold, that's the good for which we hope. God himſelfe, and all the good things of eternall life, which God hath promiſed, are this hope. This hope alſo <hi>Job</hi> had, and he knew where it was: as he knew he had the grace of hope in his heart, ſo that hee had the choyceſt good of hope in Heaven, nor would he have parted with this hope for all the poſſeſſions in the World.</p>
                  <p>But as hope (whether in the object or in the actings of it)
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:48478:272"/> reſpects temporall, or earthly things; <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>And now where is my hope?</hi> that is, If I waite and hope about theſe things, my labour is loſt, my hopes are vaine and vaniſhing, yea already vaniſhed, as the next clauſe (which is of the ſame ſenſe with this, and therefore needs no explication) further ſheweth.</p>
                  <q>And for my hope who ſhall ſee it?</q>
                  <p>That is, Who ſhall ſee that which you would have me hope for? You would perſwade me that I ſhall be a great man; if I ſhould take up ſuch a hope, who ſhall ever ſee it made good, who ſhall ſee it fulfilled? No man ſhall.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the word which wee tranſlate <hi>Hope</hi> in both parts of this Verſe, ſignifies alſo a <hi>Congregation,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I might from this Verſe turne back to that Obſervation lately given; That a true Beleever is ſometimes able to make tryumphant reports about the wrack of his worldly hope; he can ſay, Where is it? and who ſhall ſee it?

                  <p>A third thus, <hi>They ſhall deſcend upon the barrs of the Grave:</hi> The meaning is, <hi>Yee ſhall quickly ſee mee and all my worldly hopes which yee ſo much ſpeake of, put together in a Coffin, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon a Beire to the Grave for buriall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This going downe to the barrs of the Pit, according to our reading, imports, that he and his hopes ſhould deſcend to the lower parts of the earth, the Grave, and be buryed there; the pit would ſhut him in, and make him faſt enough. The Grave is a Priſon, and there are Barrs or bolts belonging to that Priſon vvhich ſhut the Priſoners in; there's no breaking of that Priſon: The Decree of God is the Barre of the Grave, and his purpoſe locks it up till the day which himſelfe hath appointed for the reſurrection from the dead, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvhich is to follow.

                  <q>When we ſhall reſt together in the duſt.</q>
                  <p>The vvord vvhich we expreſſe by <hi>reſt,</hi> is derived by ſome, from a root ſignifying to deſcend, or goe downe; hence the difference of tranſlation. The Hebrew particle <hi>(im)</hi> which we render <hi>When,</hi> ſignifies alſo <hi>For,</hi> or <hi>Foraſmuch:</hi> Further, it is ſometimes taken conditionally, for <hi>If,</hi> as alſo interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively for <hi>(utrum) whether;</hi> according to all which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, this clauſe hath undergone a variety of reading.</p>
                  <p>But I paſſe them by, and keep to our owne, <hi>When our reſt together is in the duſt,</hi> or, <hi>for as much as we ſhall reſt together in the duſt.</hi> Of this reſt I have ſpoken before (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>There the weary be at reſt,</hi> thither I referr the Reader: Wee may alſo take <hi>Jobs</hi> ſenſe in this place, by that which hee ſpeakes ſo cleerely out to this point (<hi>Chap.</hi> 30. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23.) <hi>For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the houſe appointed for all living.</hi> I ſhall not ſtay here to draw out Obſervations; matter of this purport, about the certainty of, and about our reſt in death, having occurred heretofore: All that I ſhall add for the cloſe of this Verſe and Chapter, ſhall onely be an offer towards the reſolution of a doubt, vvhich may ariſe upon the vvhole matter of <hi>Jobs</hi> continued reſolves for death, and his refuſals of any entertainment of the hopes of life.</p>
                  <p>Hence it may be queſtioned, Did not <hi>Job</hi> ſin in giving up his hope, and in refu ing to be comforted, when his Freinds, wiſe and godly men, laboured to aſſure him of deliverance?</p>
                  <pb n="536" facs="tcp:48478:274"/>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, <hi>Job</hi> was vvilling to be comforted, but hee did not like their way of comforting, which vvas indeed a wounding; for the promiſes vvhich they made him, did all along carry an implication of his guilt, they never promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him any deliverance, but upon the ſuppoſition of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from thoſe wickedneſſes, vvith vvhich they charged him; vvhereas hee utterly denyed their charge in the ſenſe which they layd againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, Wee cannot altogether acquit <hi>Job</hi> from blame, in judging his ſtate ſo deplorable and remedileſſe. For though with an eye to the creature, and all ſecond cauſes, there was no probability, or poſſibility for his recovery, yet <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have raiſed his hopes upon the power and Al-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of God; he might have remembred that as his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was extraordinary, and the hand of God very viſible in it: So his deliverance alſo might have been as extraordinary, and that God could have put forth as ſtrong, and as viſible a hand to reſtore him as he did to caſt him downe: 'Tis ſayd of <hi>Abraham (Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19.) that <hi>he againſt hope, beleeved in hope;</hi> nothing appeared for the ſupport of his hopes, yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did not ſay, <hi>Where is my hope?</hi> or why ſhould I waite for Children, <hi>He conſidered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred yeares old, neyther yet the deadneſſe of Sarah's wombe:</hi> Theſe naturall impediments came not to his minde, while he had a word from the Lord of nature, <hi>Hee ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbeleife, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving glory to God.</hi> But we may ſay of <hi>Job</hi> (from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall tenour of his owne anſwers) that he conſidered his owne body as dead too much, and ſo attained not to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtrength of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Yet we have three things to ſay for him: Firſt, there was a great difference between his caſe and <hi>Abrahams; Job</hi> had no ſuch ground of Faith as <hi>Abraham</hi> had; <hi>Abraham</hi> received a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, yea an abſolute promiſe from God, that he ſhould have a Son, but <hi>Job</hi> received only a conditionall promiſe from man, grounded upon the generall promiſes of God, that he ſhould be reſtored: This conſideration abates much from the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his unbeleife; though it cannot be denyed, but his Faith might and ſhould have riſen higher upon the power of God, who as he was Al-ſufficiently able, ſo he did afterwards actually raiſe him up.</p>
                  <pb n="537" facs="tcp:48478:274"/>
                  <p>Secondly, The deſigne of God being in <hi>Jobs</hi> example to ſet forth a patterne of patience, as his deſigne was in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> example to ſet forth a patterne of Faith, he was pleaſed to let <hi>Jobs</hi> Faith run it ſelfe out about ſpirituals and eternals, not minding temporals, that ſo his patience might have a perfect worke in bearing the full weight of his affliction to the end, while his Faith did not ſo much as put under a little finger to eaſe him with the leaſt beleife, that it ſhould (as to this life) be taken off, or have an end.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, (As 'twas hinted) <hi>Job</hi> had much Faith to ſome purpoſes, though none to this; hee had a full truſt in God, though he ſhould kil him, but he had no truſt that God would not kill him; he beleeved God loved him while he did afflict him, though hee did not beleeve that God would deliver him from his afflictions. <hi>As no mans Faith workes alike at all times, ſo 'tis rare that any mans Faith workes alike to all things:</hi> Some who beleeve and hope mightily for the things of Heaven, have but little, eyther Faith or Hope for earthly things: Not becauſe a Faith which ſerves for Heaven, is not enough ('tis rather more then enough) to ſerve for Earth: But becauſe moſt of thoſe whoſe Faith is ſtrong and much enlarged for Heaven, take ſo much ſatisfaction there, and are there ſo much at home, that they account themſelves Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and ſtrangers here, and are not much mindfull (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.15.) or deſirous of their earthly Countrey and concernments. <hi>What wee doe not much deſire to have, wee doe not much beleeve (though we beleeve) that we ſhall have it. A full ſoule,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, loatheth the Honey combe:</hi> Thoſe ſoules which are full of Heaven (though they doe not loath, yet they) are not hungry after (though they can thankfully receive and enjoy) any <hi>Honey-combe</hi> of this World. <hi>No man having drunk old Wine, ſtraightway deſireth new, for hee ſaith the old is better (Luke</hi> 5.39.) Doubtleſſe <hi>Job</hi> had drunk the old Wine of Gods favour and love in the Redeemer, and ſo his thirſt was much ſlacked, if not totally quenched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the new Wine of a temporall reſtauration. And hence we may not onely charitably, but more then probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That it was not for want of Faith, that <hi>Job</hi> did not beleeve or hope for what his Freinds promiſed him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had employed his Faith upon better and more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Thus <hi>Job</hi> hath finiſht his anſwer to the ſecond charge of <hi>Eliphaz:</hi> And (through the helpe of Chriſt) ſomewhat is here tendered for the illuſtration and expoſition of it. His other two Freinds, <hi>Bildad,</hi> and <hi>Zophar,</hi> ſtand ready to enter the Liſts with him, and to renew their charge; what they ſayd, and what anſwer they received, ſhall (if God continue life and ſtrength, with theſe peaceable opportunities) in convenient time be preſented to publick view.</p>
